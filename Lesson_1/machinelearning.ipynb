      "Towards the end of November, during a thaw, at nine oâclock one\n",
      "morning, a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching\n",
      "the latter city at full speed. The morning was so damp and misty that\n",
      "it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking;\n",
      "and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards\n",
      "away from the carriage windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from\n",
      "abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly\n",
      "with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked\n",
      "up at the different stations nearer town. All of them seemed weary, and\n",
      "most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their\n",
      "complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog\n",
      "outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages\n",
      "found themselves opposite each other. Both were young fellows, both\n",
      "were rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were\n",
      "evidently anxious to start a conversation. If they had but known why,\n",
      "at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they\n",
      "would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set\n",
      "them down opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the\n",
      "Warsaw Railway Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with\n",
      "black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes. His nose was broad and\n",
      "flat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly\n",
      "compressed into an impudent, ironicalâit might almost be called a\n",
      "maliciousâsmile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned\n",
      "for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. A\n",
      "special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which\n",
      "gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of\n",
      "his hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering\n",
      "expression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile\n",
      "and keen, self-satisfied bearing. He wore a large furâor rather\n",
      "astrachanâovercoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his\n",
      "neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian\n",
      "November night entirely unprepared. His wide sleeveless mantle with a\n",
      "large cape to itâthe sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the\n",
      "winter months in Switzerland or North Italyâwas by no means adapted to\n",
      "the long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six\n",
      "or twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very\n",
      "fair, with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were\n",
      "large and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy\n",
      "expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as\n",
      "evidence, of an epileptic subject. His face was decidedly a pleasant\n",
      "one for all that; refined, but quite colourless, except for the\n",
      "circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold. He held a\n",
      "bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently\n",
      "contained all his travelling wardrobe, and wore thick shoes and\n",
      "gaiters, his whole appearance being very un-Russian.\n",
      "\n",
      "His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having\n",
      "nothing better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment\n",
      "of the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show:\n",
      "\n",
      "âCold?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âVery,â said his neighbour, readily, âand this is a thaw, too. Fancy if\n",
      "it had been a hard frost! I never thought it would be so cold in the\n",
      "old country. Iâve grown quite out of the way of it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat, been abroad, I suppose?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, straight from Switzerland.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWheugh! my goodness!â The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then\n",
      "laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation proceeded. The readiness of the fair-haired young man\n",
      "in the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbourâs questions was\n",
      "surprising. He seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or\n",
      "inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him.\n",
      "Replying to them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had\n",
      "been long absent from Russia, more than four years; that he had been\n",
      "sent abroad for his health; that he had suffered from some strange\n",
      "nervous maladyâa kind of epilepsy, with convulsive spasms. His\n",
      "interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers; and more\n",
      "than ever, when to the question, âwhether he had been cured?â the\n",
      "patient replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, they did not cure me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHey! thatâs it! You stumped up your money for nothing, and we believe\n",
      "in those fellows, here!â remarked the black-haired individual,\n",
      "sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!â exclaimed another passenger, a\n",
      "shabbily dressed man of about forty, who looked like a clerk, and\n",
      "possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face. âGospel truth! All they\n",
      "do is to get hold of our good Russian money free, gratis, and for\n",
      "nothing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, but youâre quite wrong in my particular instance,â said the Swiss\n",
      "patient, quietly. âOf course I canât argue the matter, because I know\n",
      "only my own case; but my doctor gave me moneyâand he had very littleâto\n",
      "pay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own expense, while\n",
      "there, for nearly two years.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy? Was there no one else to pay for you?â asked the black-haired\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNoâMr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there, died a couple of\n",
      "years ago. I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin at the time (she is a\n",
      "distant relative of mine), but she did not answer my letter. And so\n",
      "eventually I came back.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd where have you come to?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat isâwhere am I going to stay? IâI really donât quite know yet, Iââ\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the listeners laughed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?â asked the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI bet anything it is!â exclaimed the red-nosed passenger, with extreme\n",
      "satisfaction, âand that he has precious little in the luggage\n",
      "van!âthough of course poverty is no crimeâwe must remember that!â\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. The young fellow\n",
      "hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYour bundle has some importance, however,â continued the clerk, when\n",
      "they had laughed their fill (it was observable that the subject of\n",
      "their mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing); âfor\n",
      "though I dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs dâor and louis\n",
      "dâorâjudge from your costume and gaitersâstillâif you can add to your\n",
      "possessions such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General\n",
      "Epanchin, then your bundle becomes a significant object at once. That\n",
      "is, of course, if you really are a relative of Mrs. Epanchinâs, and\n",
      "have not made a little error throughâwell, absence of mind, which is\n",
      "very common to human beings; or, sayâthrough a too luxuriant fancy?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, you are right again,â said the fair-haired traveller, âfor I\n",
      "really am _almost_ wrong when I say she and I are related. She is\n",
      "hardly a relation at all; so little, in fact, that I was not in the\n",
      "least surprised to have no answer to my letter. I expected as much.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHâm! you spent your postage for nothing, then. Hâm! you are candid,\n",
      "howeverâand that is commendable. Hâm! Mrs. Epanchinâoh yes! a most\n",
      "eminent person. I know her. As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you in\n",
      "Switzerland, I know him tooâat least, if it was Nicolai Andreevitch of\n",
      "that name? A fine fellow he wasâand had a property of four thousand\n",
      "souls in his day.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, Nicolai Andreevitchâthat was his name,â and the young fellow\n",
      "looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all-knowing gentleman with\n",
      "the red nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain\n",
      "class. They are people who know everyoneâthat is, they know where a man\n",
      "is employed, what his salary is, whom he knows, whom he married, what\n",
      "money his wife had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc.\n",
      "These men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on, and\n",
      "they spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style\n",
      "of knowledge, which they reduceâor raiseâto the standard of a science.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the latter part of the conversation the black-haired young man\n",
      "had become very impatient. He stared out of the window, and fidgeted,\n",
      "and evidently longed for the end of the journey. He was very absent; he\n",
      "would appear to listenâand heard nothing; and he would laugh of a\n",
      "sudden, evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about.\n",
      "\n",
      "âExcuse me,â said the red-nosed man to the young fellow with the\n",
      "bundle, rather suddenly; âwhom have I the honour to be talking to?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âPrince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin,â replied the latter, with perfect\n",
      "readiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPrince Muishkin? Lef Nicolaievitch? Hâm! I donât know, Iâm sure! I may\n",
      "say I have never heard of such a person,â said the clerk, thoughtfully.\n",
      "âAt least, the name, I admit, is historical. Karamsin must mention the\n",
      "family name, of course, in his historyâbut as an individualâone never\n",
      "hears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course not,â replied the prince; âthere are none, except myself. I\n",
      "believe I am the last and only one. As to my forefathers, they have\n",
      "always been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army.\n",
      "I donât know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she\n",
      "is descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of\n",
      "her line.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd did you learn science and all that, with your professor over\n",
      "there?â asked the black-haired passenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh yesâI did learn a little, butââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâve never learned anything whatever,â said the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, but I learned very little, you know!â added the prince, as though\n",
      "excusing himself. âThey could not teach me very much on account of my\n",
      "illness.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you know the Rogojins?â asked his questioner, abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, I donâtânot at all! I hardly know anyone in Russia. Why, is that\n",
      "your name?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âParfen Rogojin? dear meâthen donât you belong to those very Rogojins,\n",
      "perhapsââ began the clerk, with a very perceptible increase of civility\n",
      "in his tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYesâthose very ones,â interrupted Rogojin, impatiently, and with scant\n",
      "courtesy. I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the\n",
      "blotchy-faced passenger, and had hitherto addressed all his remarks\n",
      "direct to the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDear meâis it possible?â observed the clerk, while his face assumed an\n",
      "expression of great deference and servilityâif not of absolute alarm:\n",
      "âwhat, a son of that very Semen Rogojinâhereditary honourable\n",
      "citizenâwho died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of\n",
      "roubles?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd how do _you_ know that he left two million and a half of roubles?â\n",
      "asked Rogojin, disdainfully, and not deigning so much as to look at the\n",
      "other. âHowever, itâs true enough that my father died a month ago, and\n",
      "that here am I returning from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a boot\n",
      "to my foot. Theyâve treated me like a dog! Iâve been ill of fever at\n",
      "Pskoff the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I\n",
      "received from my mother or my confounded brother!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd now youâll have a million roubles, at leastâgoodness gracious me!â\n",
      "exclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "âFive weeks since, I was just like yourself,â continued Rogojin,\n",
      "addressing the prince, âwith nothing but a bundle and the clothes I\n",
      "wore. I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my auntâs house,\n",
      "where I caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was\n",
      "away. All honour to my respected fatherâs memoryâbut he uncommonly\n",
      "nearly killed me, all the same. Give you my word, prince, if I hadnât\n",
      "cut and run then, when I did, heâd have murdered me like a dog.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI suppose you angered him somehow?â asked the prince, looking at the\n",
      "millionaire with considerable curiosity. But though there may have been\n",
      "something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of\n",
      "roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested\n",
      "the prince more than that. Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken up the\n",
      "conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a\n",
      "considerable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was\n",
      "in real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking, as\n",
      "safety-valve to his agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for his red-nosed neighbour, the latterâsince the information as to\n",
      "the identity of Rogojinâhung over him, seemed to be living on the honey\n",
      "of his words and in the breath of his nostrils, catching at every\n",
      "syllable as though it were a pearl of great price.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, yes; I angered himâI certainly did anger him,â replied Rogojin.\n",
      "âBut what puts me out so is my brother. Of course my mother couldnât do\n",
      "anythingâsheâs too oldâand whatever brother Senka says is law for her!\n",
      "But why couldnât he let me know? He sent a telegram, they say. Whatâs\n",
      "the good of a telegram? It frightened my aunt so that she sent it back\n",
      "to the office unopened, and there itâs been ever since! Itâs only\n",
      "thanks to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all about it. He says\n",
      "my brother cut off the gold tassels from my fatherâs coffin, at night\n",
      "âbecause theyâre worth a lot of money!â says he. Why, I can get him\n",
      "sent off to Siberia for that alone, if I like; itâs sacrilege. Here,\n",
      "youâscarecrow!â he added, addressing the clerk at his side, âis it\n",
      "sacrilege or not, by law?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSacrilege, certainlyâcertainly sacrilege,â said the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd itâs Siberia for sacrilege, isnât it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âUndoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThey will think that Iâm still ill,â continued Rogojin to the prince,\n",
      "âbut I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the train and came\n",
      "away. Aha, brother Senka, youâll have to open your gates and let me in,\n",
      "my boy! I know he told tales about me to my fatherâI know that well\n",
      "enough but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna\n",
      "thatâs very sure, and that was my own doing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNastasia Philipovna?â said the clerk, as though trying to think out\n",
      "something.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome, you know nothing about _her_,â said Rogojin, impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd supposing I do know something?â observed the other, triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBosh! there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas. And what an\n",
      "impertinent beast you are!â he added angrily. âI thought some creature\n",
      "like you would hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, but I do know, as it happens,â said the clerk in an aggravating\n",
      "manner. âLebedeff knows all about her. You are pleased to reproach me,\n",
      "your excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all?\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovnaâs family name is BarashkoffâI know, you seeâand she\n",
      "is a very well known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too. She\n",
      "is connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of considerable\n",
      "property, a director of companies, and so on, and a great friend of\n",
      "General Epanchin, who is interested in the same matters as he is.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMy eyes!â said Rogojin, really surprised at last. âThe devil take the\n",
      "fellow, how does he know that?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, he knows everythingâLebedeff knows everything! I was a month or\n",
      "two with Lihachof after his father died, your excellency, and while he\n",
      "was knocking aboutâheâs in the debtorâs prison nowâI was with him, and\n",
      "he couldnât do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna and several people at that time.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNastasia Philipovna? Why, you donât mean to say that she and\n",
      "Lihachofââ cried Rogojin, turning quite pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, no, no, no, no! Nothing of the sort, I assure you!â said Lebedeff,\n",
      "hastily. âOh dear no, not for the world! Totskiâs the only man with any\n",
      "chance there. Oh, no! He takes her to his box at the opera at the\n",
      "French theatre of an evening, and the officers and people all look at\n",
      "her and say, âBy Jove, thereâs the famous Nastasia Philipovna!â but no\n",
      "one ever gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, itâs quite true,â said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; âso Zaleshoff\n",
      "told me. I was walking about the Nefsky one fine day, prince, in my\n",
      "fatherâs old coat, when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped\n",
      "into her carriage. I swear I was all of a blaze at once. Then I met\n",
      "Zaleshoffâlooking like a hair-dresserâs assistant, got up as fine as I\n",
      "donât know who, while I looked like a tinker. âDonât flatter yourself,\n",
      "my boy,â said he; âsheâs not for such as you; sheâs a princess, she is,\n",
      "and her name is Nastasia Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives with\n",
      "Totski, who wishes to get rid of her because heâs growing rather\n",
      "oldâfifty-five or soâand wants to marry a certain beauty, the loveliest\n",
      "woman in all Petersburg.â And then he told me that I could see Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna at the opera-house that evening, if I liked, and described\n",
      "which was her box. Well, Iâd like to see my father allowing any of us\n",
      "to go to the theatre; heâd sooner have killed us, any day. However, I\n",
      "went for an hour or so and saw Nastasia Philipovna, and I never slept a\n",
      "wink all night after. Next morning my father happened to give me two\n",
      "government loan bonds to sell, worth nearly five thousand roubles each.\n",
      "âSell them,â said he, âand then take seven thousand five hundred\n",
      "roubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me back the\n",
      "rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on the way; look\n",
      "sharp, I shall be waiting for you.â Well, I sold the bonds, but I\n",
      "didnât take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went straight\n",
      "to the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a diamond the\n",
      "size of a nut in each. They cost four hundred roubles more than I had,\n",
      "so I gave my name, and they trusted me. With the earrings I went at\n",
      "once to Zaleshoffâs. âCome on!â I said, âcome on to Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovnaâs,â and off we went without more ado. I tell you I hadnât a\n",
      "notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way;\n",
      "I saw nothing whatever. We went straight into her drawing-room, and\n",
      "then she came out to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI didnât say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: âFrom Parfen\n",
      "Rogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday; be so kind\n",
      "as to accept these!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âShe opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "ââThank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,â says she, and\n",
      "bowed and went off. Why didnât I die there on the spot? The worst of it\n",
      "all was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I\n",
      "was short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and\n",
      "never said a word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all\n",
      "in the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing\n",
      "and scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!\n",
      "\n",
      "ââLook here now,â I said, when we came out, ânone of your interference\n",
      "here after thisâdo you understand?â He laughed: âAnd how are you going\n",
      "to settle up with your father?â says he. I thought I might as well jump\n",
      "into the Neva at once without going home first; but it struck me that I\n",
      "wouldnât, after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMy goodness!â shivered the clerk. âAnd his father,â he added, for the\n",
      "princeâs instruction, âand his father would have given a man a ticket\n",
      "to the other world for ten roubles any dayânot to speak of ten\n",
      "thousand!â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he seemed paler than\n",
      "ever at this moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat do you know about it?â cried the latter. âWell, my father learned\n",
      "the whole story at once, and Zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town\n",
      "besides. So he took me upstairs and locked me up, and swore at me for\n",
      "an hour. âThis is only a foretaste,â says he; âwait a bit till night\n",
      "comes, and Iâll come back and talk to you again.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, what do you think? The old fellow went straight off to Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna, touched the floor with his forehead, and began blubbering\n",
      "and beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds. So after\n",
      "awhile she brought the box and flew out at him. âThere,â she says,\n",
      "âtake your earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten\n",
      "times dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must have\n",
      "cost Parfen to get them! Give Parfen my compliments,â she says, âand\n",
      "thank him very much!â Well, I meanwhile had borrowed twenty-five\n",
      "roubles from a friend, and off I went to Pskoff to my auntâs. The old\n",
      "woman there lectured me so that I left the house and went on a drinking\n",
      "tour round the public-houses of the place. I was in a high fever when I\n",
      "got to Pskoff, and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets\n",
      "somewhere or other!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOho! weâll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song now!â giggled\n",
      "Lebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee. âHey, my boy, weâll get her some\n",
      "proper earrings now! Weâll get her such earrings thatââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âLook here,â cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the arm, âlook\n",
      "here, if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, Iâll tan your\n",
      "hide as sure as you sit there!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAha! doâby all means! if you tan my hide you wonât turn me away from\n",
      "your society. Youâll bind me to you, with your lash, for ever. Ha, ha!\n",
      "here we are at the station, though.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly, a large\n",
      "collection of friends had assembled to greet him, and did so with\n",
      "profuse waving of hats and shouting.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, thereâs Zaleshoff here, too!â he muttered, gazing at the scene\n",
      "with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile. Then he suddenly turned\n",
      "to the prince: âPrince, I donât know why I have taken a fancy to you;\n",
      "perhaps because I met you just when I did. But no, it canât be that,\n",
      "for I met this fellowâ (nodding at Lebedeff) âtoo, and I have not taken\n",
      "a fancy to him by any means. Come to see me, prince; weâll take off\n",
      "those gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat, the best\n",
      "we can buy. You shall have a dress coat, best quality, white waistcoat,\n",
      "anything you like, and your pocket shall be full of money. Come, and\n",
      "you shall go with me to Nastasia Philipovnaâs. Now then will you come\n",
      "or no?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAccept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitchâ said Lebedef solemnly;\n",
      "âdonât let it slip! Accept, quick!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he\n",
      "replied with some cordiality:\n",
      "\n",
      "âI will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for\n",
      "taking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even come today if I have time,\n",
      "for I tell you frankly that I like you very much too. I liked you\n",
      "especially when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you\n",
      "before that as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face.\n",
      "Thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly\n",
      "shall require both clothes and coat very soon. As for money, I have\n",
      "hardly a copeck about me at this moment.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have plenty; so\n",
      "come along!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs true enough, heâll have lots before evening!â put in Lebedeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies? Letâs know that\n",
      "first?â asked Rogojin.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh no, oh no!â said the prince; âI couldnât, you knowâmy illnessâI\n",
      "hardly ever saw a soul.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHâm! wellâhere, you fellowâyou can come along with me now if you\n",
      "like!â cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they all left the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff had his desire. He went off with the noisy group of Rogojinâs\n",
      "friends towards the Voznesensky, while the princeâs route lay towards\n",
      "the Litaynaya. It was damp and wet. The prince asked his way of\n",
      "passers-by, and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his\n",
      "destination, he determined to take a droshky.\n",
      "\n",
      "II.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Epanchin lived in his own house near the Litaynaya. Besides\n",
      "this large residenceâfive-sixths of which was let in flats and\n",
      "lodgingsâthe general was owner of another enormous house in the\n",
      "Sadovaya bringing in even more rent than the first. Besides these\n",
      "houses he had a delightful little estate just out of town, and some\n",
      "sort of factory in another part of the city. General Epanchin, as\n",
      "everyone knew, had a good deal to do with certain government\n",
      "monopolies; he was also a voice, and an important one, in many rich\n",
      "public companies of various descriptions; in fact, he enjoyed the\n",
      "reputation of being a well-to-do man of busy habits, many ties, and\n",
      "affluent means. He had made himself indispensable in several quarters,\n",
      "amongst others in his department of the government; and yet it was a\n",
      "known fact that Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin was a man of no education\n",
      "whatever, and had absolutely risen from the ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "This last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit upon the\n",
      "general; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own\n",
      "little weaknessesâvery excusable ones,âone of which was a dislike to\n",
      "any allusion to the above circumstance. He was undoubtedly clever. For\n",
      "instance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain\n",
      "more by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted\n",
      "personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity, and\n",
      "because âhe knew his place.â And yet if these good people could only\n",
      "have had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who âknew his\n",
      "placeâ so well! The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of the\n",
      "world and his really remarkable abilities, he always liked to appear to\n",
      "be carrying out other peopleâs ideas rather than his own. And also, his\n",
      "luck seldom failed him, even at cards, for which he had a passion that\n",
      "he did not attempt to conceal. He played for high stakes, and moved,\n",
      "altogether, in very varied society.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life; that is,\n",
      "about fifty-five years of age,âthe flowering time of existence, when\n",
      "real enjoyment of life begins. His healthy appearance, good colour,\n",
      "sound, though discoloured teeth, sturdy figure, preoccupied air during\n",
      "business hours, and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the\n",
      "evening, all bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make\n",
      "existence a bed of roses to his excellency. The general was lord of a\n",
      "flourishing family, consisting of his wife and three grown-up\n",
      "daughters. He had married young, while still a lieutenant, his wife\n",
      "being a girl of about his own age, who possessed neither beauty nor\n",
      "education, and who brought him no more than fifty souls of landed\n",
      "property, which little estate served, however, as a nest-egg for far\n",
      "more important accumulations. The general never regretted his early\n",
      "marriage, or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he so\n",
      "respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her. Mrs.\n",
      "Epanchin came of the princely stock of Muishkin, which if not a\n",
      "brilliant, was, at all events, a decidedly ancient family; and she was\n",
      "extremely proud of her descent.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived through their long\n",
      "union very happily. While still young the wife had been able to make\n",
      "important friends among the aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family\n",
      "descent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks\n",
      "to their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she\n",
      "took her place among the higher circles as by right.\n",
      "\n",
      "During these last few years all three of the generalâs\n",
      "daughtersâAlexandra, Adelaida, and Aglayaâhad grown up and matured. Of\n",
      "course they were only Epanchins, but their motherâs family was noble;\n",
      "they might expect considerable fortunes; their father had hopes of\n",
      "attaining to very high rank indeed in his countryâs serviceâall of\n",
      "which was satisfactory. All three of the girls were decidedly pretty,\n",
      "even the eldest, Alexandra, who was just twenty-five years old. The\n",
      "middle daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was\n",
      "twenty. This youngest girl was absolutely a beauty, and had begun of\n",
      "late to attract considerable attention in society. But this was not\n",
      "all, for every one of the three was clever, well educated, and\n",
      "accomplished.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very\n",
      "fond of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even\n",
      "said that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake\n",
      "of the idol of the household, Aglaya. In society they not only disliked\n",
      "asserting themselves, but were actually retiring. Certainly no one\n",
      "could blame them for being too arrogant or haughty, and yet everybody\n",
      "was well aware that they were proud and quite understood their own\n",
      "value. The eldest was musical, while the second was a clever artist,\n",
      "which fact she had concealed until lately. In a word, the world spoke\n",
      "well of the girls; but they were not without their enemies, and\n",
      "occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had\n",
      "read.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in no hurry to marry. They liked good society, but were not\n",
      "too keen about it. All this was the more remarkable, because everyone\n",
      "was well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about eleven oâclock in the forenoon when the prince rang the\n",
      "bell at General Epanchinâs door. The general lived on the first floor\n",
      "or flat of the house, as modest a lodging as his position permitted. A\n",
      "liveried servant opened the door, and the prince was obliged to enter\n",
      "into long explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance,\n",
      "looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion. At last, however, on\n",
      "the repeated positive assurance that he really was Prince Muishkin, and\n",
      "must absolutely see the general on business, the bewildered domestic\n",
      "showed him into a little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that\n",
      "adjoined the generalâs study, there handing him over to another\n",
      "servant, whose duty it was to be in this ante-chamber all the morning,\n",
      "and announce visitors to the general. This second individual wore a\n",
      "dress coat, and was some forty years of age; he was the generalâs\n",
      "special study servant, and well aware of his own importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle here,â said the\n",
      "door-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in his own easy-chair in the\n",
      "ante-chamber. He looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter\n",
      "settled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his\n",
      "knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf you donât mind, I would rather sit here with you,â said the prince;\n",
      "âI should prefer it to sitting in there.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, but you canât stay here. You are a visitorâa guest, so to speak.\n",

      "yet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, I didnât mean in this room! I know I canât smoke here, of course.\n",
      "Iâd adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to. You\n",

      "servant. âIn the first place, youâve no right in here at all; you ought\n",
      "to be in the waiting-room, because youâre a sort of visitorâa guest, in\n",
      "factâand I shall catch it for this. Look here, do you intend to take up\n",

      "\n",
      "âNo, I donât think so. I donât think I should stay even if they were to\n",

      "more.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMake their acquaintance?â asked the man, in amazement, and with\n",

      "general?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh well, very little business. There is one little matterâsome advice\n",
      "I am going to ask him for; but my principal object is simply to\n",
      "introduce myself, because I am Prince Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is\n",
      "the last of her branch of the house, and besides herself and me there\n",

      "\n",
      "âWell, hardly so. If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course,\n",
      "but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once\n",
      "wrote to your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply. However, I\n",

      "still far from comfortable on my account. All you have to do is to\n",
      "announce me as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be\n",
      "plain enough. If I am receivedâvery good; if not, well, very good\n",
      "again. But they are sure to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin\n",
      "will naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of\n",

      "rightly informed.â\n",

      "the servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common\n",
      "serving-man this state of things was highly improper. His conclusion\n",
      "was that one of two things must be the explanationâeither that this was\n",
      "a begging impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply a\n",
      "fool, without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince with any\n",

      "country life. He was educated, first by a governess, and afterwards by\n",

      "fits were so frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the\n",

      "I had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,â\n",
      "added Gania, with an unpleasant smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, nonsense, nonsense,â said the general, with decision. âWhat\n",
      "extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; thatâs not\n",
      "her way at all. Besides, what could _you_ give her, without having\n",
      "thousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait,\n",
      "however. Has she ever asked you for it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you havenât\n",
      "forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of\n",
      "those specially invited, you know.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I should think\n",
      "so! Sheâs twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must\n",
      "be ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy\n",
      "Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no. So\n",
      "be prepared!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than\n",
      "ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAre you sure she said that?â he asked, and his voice seemed to quiver\n",
      "as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, she promised. We both worried her so that she gave in; but she\n",
      "wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The general watched Ganiaâs confusion intently, and clearly did not\n",
      "like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âRemember, Ivan Fedorovitch,â said Gania, in great agitation, âthat I\n",

      "have my âyes or noâ free.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, donât you, arenât youââ began the general, in alarm.\n",

      "âOh, donât misunderstandââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you mean?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, Iâm not rejecting her. I may have expressed myself badly, but I\n",
      "didnât mean that.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âReject her! I should think not!â said the general with annoyance, and\n",
      "apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it. âWhy, my dear\n",
      "fellow, itâs not a question of your rejecting her, it is whether you\n",
      "are prepared to receive her consent joyfully, and with proper\n",
      "satisfaction. How are things going on at home?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAt home? Oh, I can do as I like there, of course; only my father will\n",
      "make a fool of himself, as usual. He is rapidly becoming a general\n",
      "nuisance. I donât ever talk to him now, but I hold him in check, safe\n",
      "enough. I swear if it had not been for my mother, I should have shown\n",
      "him the way out, long ago. My mother is always crying, of course, and\n",
      "my sister sulks. I had to tell them at last that I intended to be\n",
      "master of my own destiny, and that I expect to be obeyed at home. At\n",
      "least, I gave my sister to understand as much, and my mother was\n",
      "present.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, I must say, I cannot understand it!â said the general, shrugging\n",
      "his shoulders and dropping his hands. âYou remember your mother, Nina\n",
      "Alexandrovna, that day she came and sat here and groanedâand when I\n",
      "asked her what was the matter, she says, âOh, itâs such a _dishonour_\n",
      "to us!â dishonour! Stuff and nonsense! I should like to know who can\n",
      "reproach Nastasia Philipovna, or who can say a word of any kind against\n",
      "her. Did she mean because Nastasia had been living with Totski? What\n",
      "nonsense it is! You would not let her come near your daughters, says\n",
      "Nina Alexandrovna. What next, I wonder? I donât see how she can fail\n",
      "toâto understandââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âHer own position?â prompted Gania. âShe does understand. Donât be\n",
      "annoyed with her. I have warned her not to meddle in other peopleâs\n",
      "affairs. However, although thereâs comparative peace at home at\n",
      "present, the storm will break if anything is finally settled tonight.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation, as he sat at\n",
      "the table, writing. He finished at last, and brought the result of his\n",
      "labour to the generalâs desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo this is Nastasia Philipovna,â he said, looking attentively and\n",
      "curiously at the portrait. âHow wonderfully beautiful!â he immediately\n",
      "added, with warmth. The picture was certainly that of an unusually\n",
      "lovely woman. She was photographed in a black silk dress of simple\n",
      "design, her hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged, her eyes were\n",
      "deep and thoughtful, the expression of her face passionate, but proud.\n",
      "She was rather thin, perhaps, and a little pale. Both Gania and the\n",
      "general gazed at the prince in amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow do you know itâs Nastasia Philipovna?â asked the general; âyou\n",
      "surely donât know her already, do you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, I do! I have only been one day in Russia, but I have heard of the\n",
      "great beauty!â And the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with\n",
      "Rogojin in the train and the whole of the latterâs story.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThereâs news!â said the general in some excitement, after listening to\n",
      "the story with engrossed attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, of course itâs nothing but humbug!â cried Gania, a little\n",
      "disturbed, however. âItâs all humbug; the young merchant was pleased to\n",
      "indulge in a little innocent recreation! I have heard something of\n",
      "Rogojin!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, so have I!â replied the general. âNastasia Philipovna told us all\n",
      "about the earrings that very day. But now it is quite a different\n",
      "matter. You see the fellow really has a million of roubles, and he is\n",
      "passionately in love. The whole story smells of passion, and we all\n",
      "know what this class of gentry is capable of when infatuated. I am much\n",
      "afraid of some disagreeable scandal, I am indeed!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are afraid of the million, I suppose,â said Gania, grinning and\n",
      "showing his teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd you are _not_, I presume, eh?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow did he strike you, prince?â asked Gania, suddenly. âDid he seem to\n",
      "be a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow? What was\n",
      "your own opinion about the matter?â\n",
      "\n",
      "While Gania put this question, a new idea suddenly flashed into his\n",
      "brain, and blazed out, impatiently, in his eyes. The general, who was\n",
      "really agitated and disturbed, looked at the prince too, but did not\n",
      "seem to expect much from his reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI really donât quite know how to tell you,â replied the prince, âbut\n",
      "it certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion, and not,\n",
      "perhaps, quite healthy passion. He seemed to be still far from well.\n",
      "Very likely he will be in bed again in a day or two, especially if he\n",
      "lives fast.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo! do you think so?â said the general, catching at the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, I do think so!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at any moment.\n",
      "It may be this very evening,â remarked Gania to the general, with a\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course; quite so. In that case it all depends upon what is going on\n",
      "in her brain at this moment.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou know the kind of person she is at times.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow? What kind of person is she?â cried the general, arrived at the\n",
      "limits of his patience. âLook here, Gania, donât you go annoying her\n",
      "tonight. What you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever\n",
      "you can. Well, what are you smiling at? You must understand, Gania,\n",
      "that I have no interest whatever in speaking like this. Whichever way\n",
      "the question is settled, it will be to my advantage. Nothing will move\n",
      "Totski from his resolution, so I run no risk. If there is anything I\n",
      "desire, you must know that it is your benefit only. Canât you trust me?\n",
      "You are a sensible fellow, and I have been counting on you; for, in\n",
      "this matter, that, thatââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, thatâs the chief thing,â said Gania, helping the general out of\n",
      "his difficulties again, and curling his lips in an envenomed smile,\n",
      "which he did not attempt to conceal. He gazed with his fevered eyes\n",
      "straight into those of the general, as though he were anxious that the\n",
      "latter might read his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general grew purple with anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, of course it is the chief thing!â he cried, looking sharply at\n",
      "Gania. âWhat a very curious man you are, Gania! You actually seem to be\n",
      "_glad_ to hear of this millionaire fellowâs arrivalâjust as though you\n",
      "wished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing. This is an affair\n",
      "in which you ought to act honestly with both sides, and give due\n",
      "warning, to avoid compromising others. But, even now, there is still\n",
      "time. Do you understand me? I wish to know whether you desire this\n",
      "arrangement or whether you do not? If not, say so,âandâand welcome! No\n",
      "one is trying to force you into the snare, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, if\n",
      "you see a snare in the matter, at least.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI do desire it,â murmured Gania, softly but firmly, lowering his eyes;\n",
      "and he relapsed into gloomy silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general was satisfied. He had excited himself, and was evidently\n",
      "now regretting that he had gone so far. He turned to the prince, and\n",
      "suddenly the disagreeable thought of the latterâs presence struck him,\n",
      "and the certainty that he must have heard every word of the\n",
      "conversation. But he felt at ease in another moment; it only needed one\n",
      "glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to\n",
      "fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh!â cried the general, catching sight of the princeâs specimen of\n",
      "caligraphy, which the latter had now handed him for inspection. âWhy,\n",
      "this is simply beautiful; look at that, Gania, thereâs real talent\n",
      "there!â\n",
      "\n",
      "On a sheet of thick writing-paper the prince had written in medieval\n",
      "characters the legend:\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe gentle Abbot Pafnute signed this.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere,â explained the prince, with great delight and animation,\n",
      "âthere, thatâs the abbotâs real signatureâfrom a manuscript of the\n",
      "fourteenth century. All these old abbots and bishops used to write most\n",
      "beautifully, with such taste and so much care and diligence. Have you\n",
      "no copy of Pogodin, general? If you had one I could show you another\n",
      "type. Stop a bitâhere you have the large round writing common in France\n",
      "during the eighteenth century. Some of the letters are shaped quite\n",
      "differently from those now in use. It was the writing current then, and\n",
      "employed by public writers generally. I copied this from one of them,\n",
      "and you can see how good it is. Look at the well-rounded a and d. I\n",
      "have tried to translate the French character into the Russian lettersâa\n",
      "difficult thing to do, but I think I have succeeded fairly. Here is a\n",
      "fine sentence, written in a good, original handââZeal triumphs over\n",
      "all.â That is the script of the Russian War Office. That is how\n",
      "official documents addressed to important personages should be written.\n",
      "The letters are round, the type black, and the style somewhat\n",
      "remarkable. A stylist would not allow these ornaments, or attempts at\n",
      "flourishesâjust look at these unfinished tails!âbut it has distinction\n",
      "and really depicts the soul of the writer. He would like to give play\n",
      "to his imagination, and follow the inspiration of his genius, but a\n",
      "soldier is only at ease in the guard-room, and the pen stops half-way,\n",
      "a slave to discipline. How delightful! The first time I met an example\n",
      "of this handwriting, I was positively astonished, and where do you\n",
      "think I chanced to find it? In Switzerland, of all places! Now that is\n",
      "an ordinary English hand. It can hardly be improved, it is so refined\n",
      "and exquisiteâalmost perfection. This is an example of another kind, a\n",
      "mixture of styles. The copy was given me by a French commercial\n",
      "traveller. It is founded on the English, but the downstrokes are a\n",
      "little blacker, and more marked. Notice that the oval has some slight\n",
      "modificationâit is more rounded. This writing allows for flourishes;\n",
      "now a flourish is a dangerous thing! Its use requires such taste, but,\n",
      "if successful, what a distinction it gives to the whole! It results in\n",
      "an incomparable typeâone to fall in love with!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDear me! How you have gone into all the refinements and details of the\n",

      "\n",
      "âWonderful!â said Gania. âAnd he knows it too,â he added, with a\n",

      "âYou may smile,âbut thereâs a career in this,â said the general. âYou\n",
      "donât know what a great personage I shall show this to, prince. Why,\n",
      "you can command a situation at thirty-five roubles per month to start\n",

      "not see you again today. Sit down a minute. I have told you that I\n",
      "cannot receive you myself very often, but I should like to be of some\n",
      "assistance to you, some small assistance, of a kind that would give you\n",
      "satisfaction. I shall find you a place in one of the State departments,\n",

      "you are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of Fate in a town like\n",
      "Petersburg. Nina Alexandrovna, Ganiaâs mother, and Varvara\n",
      "Alexandrovna, are ladies for whom I have the highest possible esteem\n",

      "am personally recommending you to this family, and that in so doing, I\n",
      "am more or less taking upon myself to answer for you. The terms are\n",
      "most reasonable, and I trust that your salary will very shortly prove\n",
      "amply sufficient for your expenditure. Of course pocket-money is a\n",
      "necessity, if only a little; do not be angry, prince, if I strongly\n",
      "recommend you to avoid carrying money in your pocket. But as your purse\n",
      "is quite empty at the present moment, you must allow me to press these\n",

      "Of course we will settle this little matter another time, and if you\n",

      "herâI strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the\n",

      "Gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. The latter\n",

      "Ganiaâs work. He commenced to examine the study and its contents. But\n",
      "Gania hardly so much as glanced at the papers lying before him; he was\n",
      "absent and thoughtful, and his smile and general appearance struck the\n",
      "prince still more disagreeably now that the two were left alone\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over\n",

      "\n",
      "âDo you admire that sort of woman, prince?â he asked, looking intently\n",
      "at him. He seemed to have some special object in the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs a wonderful face,â said the prince, âand I feel sure that her\n",
      "destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. Her face is\n",
      "smiling enough, but she must have suffered terriblyâhasnât she? Her\n",
      "eyes show itâthose two bones there, the little points under her eyes,\n",
      "just where the cheek begins. Itâs a proud face too, terribly proud! And\n",
      "IâI canât say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she be but\n",
      "good! That would make all well!â\n",

      "\n",
      "All three of the Miss Epanchins were fine, healthy girls, well-grown,\n",
      "with good shoulders and busts, and strongâalmost masculineâhands; and,\n",
      "of course, with all the above attributes, they enjoyed capital\n",
      "appetites, of which they were not in the least ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a\n",
      "little too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward\n",
      "deference to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave,\n",
      "had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had\n",
      "been in the habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had\n",
      "judged it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was\n",
      "well aware of the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of\n",
      "reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but\n",
      "having a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all\n",
      "times, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little\n",
      "accumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the\n",
      "family was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family\n",
      "matters can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share\n",
      "of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and\n",
      "which was nearly as good as a dinner. The young ladies used to have a\n",
      "cup of coffee each before this meal, at ten oâclock, while still in\n",
      "bed. This was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. At\n",
      "half-past twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room, and\n",
      "occasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering, if\n",
      "he had time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes of various\n",
      "kinds (the lady of the house loved these best), cutlets, and so on,\n",
      "there was generally strong beef soup, and other substantial delicacies.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the particular morning on which our story has opened, the family had\n",
      "assembled in the dining-room, and were waiting the generalâs\n",
      "appearance, the latter having promised to come this day. If he had been\n",
      "one moment late, he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up\n",
      "punctually.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and kiss her hands, as\n",
      "his custom was, he observed something in her look which boded ill. He\n",
      "thought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not\n",
      "altogether comfortable. His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and\n",
      "though they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in\n",
      "their expression as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little inclined to\n",
      "be too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an\n",
      "experienced father and husband, he judged it better to take measures at\n",
      "once to protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my\n",
      "narrative too much, if I diverge for a moment at this point, in order\n",
      "to explain the mutual relations between General Epanchinâs family and\n",
      "others acting a part in this history, at the time when we take up the\n",
      "thread of their destiny. I have already stated that the general, though\n",
      "he was a man of lowly origin, and of poor education, was, for all that,\n",
      "an experienced and talented husband and father. Among other things, he\n",
      "considered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial\n",
      "altar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes\n",
      "for their happiness, as is the custom among parents of many grown-up\n",
      "daughters. He even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this\n",
      "question, though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish,\n",
      "because unnatural; but the generalâs arguments were conclusive, and\n",
      "founded upon obvious facts. The general considered that the girlsâ\n",
      "taste and good sense should be allowed to develop and mature\n",
      "deliberately, and that the parentsâ duty should merely be to keep\n",
      "watch, in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made; but that\n",
      "the selection once effected, both father and mother were bound from\n",
      "that moment to enter heart and soul into the cause, and to see that the\n",
      "matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily\n",
      "reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides this, it was clear that the Epanchinsâ position gained each\n",
      "year, with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and\n",
      "social weight; and, therefore, the longer the girls waited, the better\n",
      "was their chance of making a brilliant match.\n",
      "\n",
      "But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more,\n",
      "equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that\n",
      "the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her\n",
      "twenty-fifth birthday. Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch\n",
      "Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing,\n",
      "announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman\n",
      "of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined\n",
      "tastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer\n",
      "and judge of beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality\n",
      "with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact\n",
      "that they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises,\n",
      "it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the\n",
      "general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated.\n",
      "Might he suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between\n",
      "himself and one of the generalâs daughters?\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the\n",
      "Epanchins was about to undergo a change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The undoubted beauty of the family, _par excellence_, was the youngest,\n",
      "Aglaya, as aforesaid. But Totski himself, though an egotist of the\n",
      "extremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was\n",
      "clearly not for such as he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or\n",
      "less exaggerated Aglayaâs chances of happiness. In their opinion, the\n",
      "latterâs destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in a\n",
      "heaven on earth. Aglayaâs husband was to be a compendium of all the\n",
      "virtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth. The two\n",
      "elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if need\n",
      "be, for Aglayaâs sake; her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general and his wife were aware of this agreement, and, therefore,\n",
      "when Totski suggested himself for one of the sisters, the parents made\n",
      "no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the\n",
      "offer, since Totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. The\n",
      "general valued the proposal very highly. He knew life, and realized\n",
      "what such an offer was worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer of the sisters to the communication was, if not conclusive,\n",
      "at least consoling and hopeful. It made known that the eldest,\n",
      "Alexandra, would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a will of her own.\n",
      "She was intelligent and kind-hearted, and, if she were to marry Totski,\n",
      "she would make him a good wife. She did not care for a brilliant\n",
      "marriage; she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten\n",
      "the life of any man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome. What\n",
      "better could Totski wish?\n",
      "\n",
      "So the matter crept slowly forward. The general and Totski had agreed\n",
      "to avoid any hasty and irrevocable step. Alexandraâs parents had not\n",
      "even begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject, when\n",
      "suddenly, as it were, a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of\n",
      "the proceedings. Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and\n",
      "that was a serious matter. A certain circumstance had crept in, a\n",
      "disagreeable and troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the\n",
      "whole business.\n",
      "\n",
      "This circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. Close\n",
      "to an estate of Totskiâs, in one of the central provinces of Russia,\n",
      "there lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the\n",
      "wretchedest description. This gentleman was noted in the district for\n",
      "his persistent ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards\n",
      "family and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate\n",
      "was mortgaged to the last acre. One day, when he had ridden over to the\n",
      "town to see a creditor, the chief peasant of his village followed him\n",
      "shortly after, with the news that his house had been burnt down, and\n",
      "that his wife had perished with it, but his children were safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could\n",
      "not stand this last stroke. He went mad and died shortly after in the\n",
      "town hospital. His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little\n",
      "girlsâtwo of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,âwere\n",
      "adopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the\n",
      "kindness of his heart. They were brought up together with the children\n",
      "of his German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them\n",
      "leftâNastasia Philipovnaâfor the other little one died of\n",
      "whooping-cough. Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon\n",
      "forgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia,\n",
      "it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how\n",
      "matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiffâs house, he was\n",
      "not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now\n",
      "dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and\n",
      "bright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual qualityâas to\n",
      "which last Totski was an undoubted authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "He only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion, but he\n",
      "had time to make his arrangements. Great changes took place in the\n",
      "childâs education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of\n",
      "experience and culture. For four years this lady resided in the house\n",
      "with little Nastia, and then the education was considered complete. The\n",
      "governess took her departure, and another lady came down to fetch\n",
      "Nastia, by Totskiâs instructions. The child was now transported to\n",
      "another of Totskiâs estates in a distant part of the country. Here she\n",
      "found a delightful little house, just built, and prepared for her\n",
      "reception with great care and taste; and here she took up her abode\n",
      "together with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home. In\n",
      "the house there were two experienced maids, musical instruments of all\n",
      "sorts, a charming âyoung ladyâs library,â pictures, paint-boxes, a\n",
      "lap-dog, and everything to make life agreeable. Within a fortnight\n",
      "Totski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a\n",
      "great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer,\n",
      "staying two and three months at a time. So passed four years peacefully\n",
      "and happily, in charming surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of that time, and about four months after Totskiâs last\n",
      "visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report\n",
      "reached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St.\n",
      "Petersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only\n",
      "partially true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition;\n",
      "but a great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly\n",
      "displayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in\n",
      "thought, she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg,\n",
      "straight to Totskiâs house, all alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure;\n",
      "but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and\n",
      "everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone. An\n",
      "entirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and the\n",
      "girl he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in\n",
      "common.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, this new woman understood a good deal more than was\n",
      "usual for young people of her age; so much indeed, that Totski could\n",
      "not help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. Surely not\n",
      "from her âyoung ladyâs libraryâ? It even embraced legal matters, and\n",
      "the âworldâ in general, to a considerable extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her character was absolutely changed. No more of the girlish\n",
      "alternations of timidity and petulance, the adorable naivete, the\n",
      "reveries, the tears, the playfulness... It was an entirely new and\n",
      "hitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him, and informed him\n",
      "to his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any\n",
      "kind, except loathing and contemptâcontempt which had followed closely\n",
      "upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first\n",
      "acquaintance with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new woman gave him further to understand that though it was\n",
      "absolutely the same to her whom he married, yet she had decided to\n",
      "prevent this marriageâfor no particular reason, but that she _chose_ to\n",
      "do so, and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that\n",
      "it was âquite her turn to laugh a little now!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were her wordsâvery likely she did not give her real reason for\n",
      "this eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that was all the\n",
      "explanation she deigned to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered\n",
      "ideas would permit. His meditations lasted a fortnight, however, and at\n",
      "the end of that time his resolution was taken. The fact was, Totski was\n",
      "at that time a man of fifty years of age; his position was solid and\n",
      "respectable; his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe\n",
      "foundations; he loved himself, his personal comforts, and his position\n",
      "better than all the world, as every respectable gentleman should!\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed Totski that\n",
      "he now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the\n",
      "ordinary rules of traditional behaviour, and who would not only\n",
      "threaten mischief but would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was evidently, he concluded, something at work here; some storm\n",
      "of the mind, some paroxysm of romantic anger, goodness knows against\n",
      "whom or what, some insatiable contemptâin a word, something altogether\n",
      "absurd and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be met\n",
      "with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a man of Totskiâs wealth and standing, it would, of course, have\n",
      "been the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at\n",
      "once from all annoyance; while it was obviously impossible for Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna to harm him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a\n",
      "scandal, for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove\n",
      "her to a sphere of safety. However, these arguments would only hold\n",
      "good in case of Nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency.\n",
      "She was much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct\n",
      "by some extraordinary eccentricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good stead. He realized\n",
      "that Nastasia Philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing\n",
      "by legal means to injure him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some\n",
      "entirely different intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of\n",
      "perpetrating something which would send her to Siberia, for the mere\n",
      "pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a\n",
      "sense of loathing and contempt. He had sufficient insight to understand\n",
      "that she valued nothing in the worldâherself least of allâand he made\n",
      "no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects.\n",
      "For instance, if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the\n",
      "altar, or publicly insulted, he would undoubtedly have been frightened;\n",
      "but not so much at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted,\n",
      "as at the thought that if such things were to happen he would be made\n",
      "to look ridiculous in the eyes of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound\n",
      "him and how, and therefore, as the marriage was still only in embryo,\n",
      "Totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. His decision was\n",
      "strengthened by the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered\n",
      "of late. It would be difficult to conceive how different she was\n",
      "physically, at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago. She\n",
      "was pretty then... but now!... Totski laughed angrily when he thought\n",
      "how short-sighted he had been. In days gone by he remembered how he had\n",
      "looked at her beautiful eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their\n",
      "dark mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to\n",
      "seek an answer to some unknown riddle. Her complexion also had altered.\n",
      "She was now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her\n",
      "more beautiful. Like most men of the world, Totski had rather despised\n",
      "such a cheaply-bought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think\n",
      "differently about it. It had struck him as long ago as last spring that\n",
      "he ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some\n",
      "respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office\n",
      "in another part of the country. How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the\n",
      "idea of such a thing, now!\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of her in another\n",
      "way; and he determined to establish her in St. Petersburg, surrounding\n",
      "her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command.\n",
      "In this way he might gain glory in certain circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that\n",
      "time a great deal happened. Totskiâs position was very uncomfortable;\n",
      "having âfunkedâ once, he could not totally regain his ease. He was\n",
      "afraid, he did not know why, but he was simply _afraid_ of Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna. For the first two years or so he had suspected that she\n",
      "wished to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her\n",
      "telling him so. He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a\n",
      "humble proposal from his own side. But to his great, and not entirely\n",
      "pleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the\n",
      "case, and that were he to offer himself he would be refused. He could\n",
      "not understand such a state of things, and was obliged to conclude that\n",
      "it was pride, the pride of an injured and imaginative woman, which had\n",
      "gone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt\n",
      "and hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto\n",
      "unattainable splendour. To make matters worse, she was quite impervious\n",
      "to mercenary considerations, and could not be bribed in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be\n",
      "free. He tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart; he\n",
      "invited princes, hussars, secretaries of embassies, poets, novelists,\n",
      "even Socialists, to see her; but not one of them all made the faintest\n",
      "impression upon Nastasia. It was as though she had a pebble in place of\n",
      "a heart, as though her feelings and affections were dried up and\n",
      "withered for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "She lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she loved\n",
      "music. Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a\n",
      "couple of actresses, and the family of a poor schoolteacher. Among\n",
      "these people she was much beloved.\n",
      "\n",
      "She received four or five friends sometimes, of an evening. Totski\n",
      "often came. Lately, too, General Epanchin had been enabled with great\n",
      "difficulty to introduce himself into her circle. Gania made her\n",
      "acquaintance also, and others were Ferdishenko, an ill-bred, and\n",
      "would-be witty, young clerk, and Ptitsin, a money-lender of modest and\n",
      "polished manners, who had risen from poverty. In fact, Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovnaâs beauty became a thing known to all the town; but not a\n",
      "single man could boast of anything more than his own admiration for\n",
      "her; and this reputation of hers, and her wit and culture and grace,\n",
      "all confirmed Totski in the plan he had now prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was at this moment that General Epanchin began to play so large\n",
      "and important a part in the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly\n",
      "counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters, he had made a full\n",
      "and candid confession. He had said that he intended to stop at no means\n",
      "to obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him\n",
      "entirely alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her;\n",
      "words were not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some\n",
      "sort. So he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal\n",
      "to her heart would effect. Having arrived at Nastasiaâs house one day,\n",
      "with Epanchin, Totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable\n",
      "torment of his position. He admitted that he was to blame for all, but\n",
      "candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse\n",
      "for his original guilt towards herself, because he was a man of sensual\n",
      "passions which were inborn and ineradicable, and that he had no power\n",
      "over himself in this respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry\n",
      "at last, and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union\n",
      "which he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided his all\n",
      "to her generosity of heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father\n",
      "of a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any\n",
      "attempt at sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of her\n",
      "right to be the arbiter of Totskiâs destiny at this moment. He then\n",
      "pointed out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his\n",
      "other daughters, now hung upon her reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Nastasiaâs question as to what they wished her to do, Totski\n",
      "confessed that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that\n",
      "he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married.\n",
      "He immediately added that such a suggestion from him would, of course,\n",
      "be absurd, unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. He\n",
      "very well knew, he said, that a certain young gentleman of good family,\n",
      "namely, Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom she was acquainted,\n",
      "and whom she received at her house, had long loved her passionately,\n",
      "and would give his life for some response from her. The young fellow\n",
      "had confessed this love of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it\n",
      "in the hearing of his benefactor, General Epanchin. Lastly, he could\n",
      "not help being of opinion that Nastasia must be aware of Ganiaâs love\n",
      "for her, and if he (Totski) mistook not, she had looked with some\n",
      "favour upon it, being often lonely, and rather tired of her present\n",
      "life. Having remarked how difficult it was for him, of all people, to\n",
      "speak to her of these matters, Totski concluded by saying that he\n",
      "trusted Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he\n",
      "now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of\n",
      "seventy-five thousand roubles. He added that the sum would have been\n",
      "left her all the same in his will, and that therefore she must not\n",
      "consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything,\n",
      "but that there was no reason, after all, why a man should not be\n",
      "allowed to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc.,\n",
      "etc.; in fact, all that would naturally be said under the\n",
      "circumstances. Totski was very eloquent all through, and, in\n",
      "conclusion, just touched on the fact that not a soul in the world, not\n",
      "even General Epanchin, had ever heard a word about the above\n",
      "seventy-five thousand roubles, and that this was the first time he had\n",
      "ever given expression to his intentions in respect to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovnaâs reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the\n",
      "friends considerably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only was there no trace of her former irony, of her old hatred and\n",
      "enmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the very recollection of which\n",
      "sent a cold chill down Totskiâs back to this very day; but she seemed\n",
      "charmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously\n",
      "with him for once in a way. She confessed that she had long wished to\n",
      "have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but\n",
      "that pride had hitherto prevented her; now, however, that the ice was\n",
      "broken, nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her\n",
      "eyes, she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now\n",
      "quite out of the question. She said that she had long since changed her\n",
      "views of things, and recognized that facts must be taken into\n",
      "consideration in spite of the feelings of the heart. What was done was\n",
      "done and ended, and she could not understand why Totski should still\n",
      "feel alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most courteously,\n",
      "that she had long since known of his daughters, and that she had heard\n",
      "none but good report; that she had learned to think of them with deep\n",
      "and sincere respect. The idea alone that she could in any way serve\n",
      "them, would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski had judged\n",
      "her thoughts aright. She longed to rise, if not to love, at least to\n",
      "family life and new hopes and objects, but as to Gavrila\n",
      "Ardalionovitch, she could not as yet say much. She thought it must be\n",
      "the case that he loved her; she felt that she too might learn to love\n",
      "him, if she could be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself;\n",
      "but he was very young, and it was a difficult question to decide. What\n",
      "she specially liked about him was that he worked, and supported his\n",
      "family by his toil.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had heard much that\n",
      "was interesting of his mother and sister, she had heard of them from\n",
      "Mr. Ptitsin, and would much like to make their acquaintance,\n",
      "butâanother question!âwould they like to receive her into their house?\n",
      "At all events, though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she\n",
      "desired not to be hurried. As for the seventy-five thousand roubles,\n",
      "Mr. Totski need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the\n",
      "matter; she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course,\n",
      "accept the gift. She thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no\n",
      "reason why Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it.\n",

      "something for him, to show my handwriting, I wrote âThe Abbot Pafnute\n",

      "himself and Mrs. Epanchin, but the talk, and the opportunity of\n",

      "treatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy,\n",

      "that grew outside his gratingâbut I think I had better tell you of\n",
      "another man I met last year. There was a very strange feature in this\n",
      "case, strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. This man had\n",
      "once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and\n",
      "had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some\n",
      "political crime. Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some\n",
      "other punishment substituted; but the interval between the two\n",
      "sentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been\n",
      "passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. I was\n",
      "very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful\n",
      "time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and\n",
      "felt. He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary\n",
      "distinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of\n",
      "the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAbout twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the\n",
      "sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the\n",
      "criminals (of whom there were several). The first three criminals were\n",
      "taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn\n",
      "over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at\n",
      "them. Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post.\n",
      "My friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been\n",

      "\n",
      "âHe said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most\n",

      "living, in these minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet\n",
      "to think of that last moment, so that he made several arrangements,\n",
      "dividing up the time into portionsâone for saying farewell to his\n",
      "companions, two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over\n",
      "his own life and career and all about himself; and another minute for a\n",
      "last look around. He remembered having divided his time like this quite\n",
      "well. While saying good-bye to his friends he recollected asking one of\n",
      "them some very usual everyday question, and being much interested in\n",
      "the answer. Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two\n",
      "minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself; he knew\n",
      "beforehand what he was going to think about. He wished to put it to\n",
      "himself as quickly and clearly as possible, that here was he, a living,\n",
      "thinking man, and that in three minutes he would be nobody; or if\n",
      "somebody or something, then what and where? He thought he would decide\n",
      "this question once for all in these last three minutes. A little way\n",
      "off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. He\n",
      "remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of light\n",
      "sparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes from these rays of light;\n",

      "ask about this friend of yours, who told you the terrible experience of\n",
      "his life? He was reprieved, you say; in other words, they did restore\n",

      "could live happily for a hundred years at least. One might show you the\n",
      "execution of a felon, or show you oneâs little finger. You could draw a\n",

      "the face alone, do you mean?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt was just a minute before the execution,â began the prince, readily,\n",
      "carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything\n",
      "else in a moment; âjust at the instant when he stepped off the ladder\n",
      "on to the scaffold. He happened to look in my direction: I saw his eyes\n",
      "and understood all, at onceâbut how am I to describe it? I do so wish\n",
      "you or somebody else could draw it, you, if possible. I thought at the\n",
      "time what a picture it would make. You must imagine all that went\n",
      "before, of course, allâall. He had lived in the prison for some time\n",

      "week yetâhe had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time;\n",
      "but it so happened that his papers had been got ready quickly. At five\n",
      "oâclock in the morning he was asleepâit was October, and at five in the\n",
      "morning it was cold and dark. The governor of the prison comes in on\n",
      "tip-toe and touches the sleeping manâs shoulder gently. He starts up.\n",
      "âWhat is it?â he says. âThe execution is fixed for ten oâclock.â He was\n",
      "only just awake, and would not believe at first, but began to argue\n",
      "that his papers would not be out for a week, and so on. When he was\n",
      "wide awake and realized the truth, he became very silent and argued no\n",
      "moreâso they say; but after a bit he said: âIt comes very hard on one\n",
      "so suddenlyâ and then he was silent again and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe three or four hours went by, of course, in necessary\n",
      "preparationsâthe priest, breakfast, (coffee, meat, and some wine they\n",
      "gave him; doesnât it seem ridiculous?) And yet I believe these people\n",
      "give them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart, and believe\n",
      "that they are doing a good action. Then he is dressed, and then begins\n",
      "the procession through the town to the scaffold. I think he, too, must\n",
      "feel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along.\n",
      "Probably he thought, on the way, âOh, I have a long, long time yet.\n",
      "Three streets of life yet! When weâve passed this street thereâll be\n",
      "that other one; and then that one where the bakerâs shop is on the\n",
      "right; and when shall we get there? Itâs ages, ages!â Around him are\n",
      "crowds shouting, yellingâten thousand faces, twenty thousand eyes. All\n",
      "this has to be endured, and especially the thought: âHere are ten\n",
      "thousand men, and not one of them is going to be executed, and yet I am\n",
      "to die.â Well, all that is preparatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAt the scaffold there is a ladder, and just there he burst into\n",
      "tearsâand this was a strong man, and a terribly wicked one, they say!\n",
      "There was a priest with him the whole time, talking; even in the cart\n",
      "as they drove along, he talked and talked. Probably the other heard\n",
      "nothing; he would begin to listen now and then, and at the third word\n",
      "or so he had forgotten all about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAt last he began to mount the steps; his legs were tied, so that he\n",
      "had to take very small steps. The priest, who seemed to be a wise man,\n",
      "had stopped talking now, and only held the cross for the wretched\n",
      "fellow to kiss. At the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough; but\n",
      "when he set foot on the scaffold at the top, his face suddenly became\n",
      "the colour of paper, positively like white notepaper. His legs must\n",
      "have become suddenly feeble and helpless, and he felt a choking in his\n",
      "throatâyou know the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear,\n",
      "when one does not lose oneâs wits, but is absolutely powerless to move?\n",
      "If some dreadful thing were suddenly to happen; if a house were just\n",
      "about to fall on one;âdonât you know how one would long to sit down and\n",
      "shut oneâs eyes and wait, and wait? Well, when this terrible feeling\n",
      "came over him, the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips,\n",
      "without a wordâa little silver cross it wasâand he kept on pressing it\n",
      "to the manâs lips every second. And whenever the cross touched his\n",
      "lips, the eyes would open for a moment, and the legs moved once, and he\n",
      "kissed the cross greedily, hurriedlyâjust as though he were anxious to\n",
      "catch hold of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards,\n",
      "though he could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the\n",
      "time. And so up to the very block.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment! On the\n",
      "contrary, the brain is especially active, and works\n",
      "incessantlyâprobably hard, hard, hardâlike an engine at full pressure.\n",
      "I imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his\n",
      "headâall unfinished ones, and strange, funny thoughts, very\n",
      "likely!âlike this, for instance: âThat man is looking at me, and he has\n",
      "a wart on his forehead! and the executioner has burst one of his\n",
      "buttons, and the lowest one is all rusty!â And meanwhile he notices and\n",
      "remembers everything. There is one point that cannot be forgotten,\n",
      "round which everything else dances and turns about; and because of this\n",
      "point he cannot faint, and this lasts until the very final quarter of a\n",
      "second, when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens\n",

      "_now_ about to die, and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head.\n",
      "If I lay there, I should certainly listen for that grating sound, and\n",
      "hear it, too! There would probably be but the tenth part of an instant\n",
      "left to hear it in, but one would certainly hear it. And imagine, some\n",
      "people declare that when the head flies off it is _conscious_ of having\n",

      "âWell, thenâthey were all children there, and I was always among\n",

      "in which I lived, and they went to the school thereâall of them. I did\n",
      "not teach them, oh no; there was a master for that, one Jules Thibaut.\n",
      "I may have taught them some things, but I was among them just as an\n",
      "outsider, and I passed all four years of my life there among them. I\n",
      "wished for nothing better; I used to tell them everything and hid\n",
      "nothing from them. Their fathers and relations were very angry with me,\n",
      "because the children could do nothing without me at last, and used to\n",
      "throng after me at all times. The schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in\n",
      "the end! I had many enemies, and all because of the children. Even\n",
      "Schneider reproached me. What were they afraid of? One can tell a child\n",
      "everything, anything. I have often been struck by the fact that parents\n",
      "know their children so little. They should not conceal so much from\n",
      "them. How well even little children understand that their parents\n",
      "conceal things from them, because they consider them too young to\n",
      "understand! Children are capable of giving advice in the most important\n",
      "matters. How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at\n",
      "one so sweetly and confidingly? I call them birds because there is\n",
      "nothing in the world better than birds!\n",
      "\n",
      "âHowever, most of the people were angry with me about one and the same\n",
      "thing; but Thibaut simply was jealous of me. At first he had wagged his\n",
      "head and wondered how it was that the children understood what I told\n",
      "them so well, and could not learn from him; and he laughed like\n",
      "anything when I replied that neither he nor I could teach them very\n",
      "much, but that _they_ might teach us a good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me, living\n",
      "among children as he did, is what I cannot understand. Children soothe\n",
      "and heal the wounded heart. I remember there was one poor fellow at our\n",
      "professorâs who was being treated for madness, and you have no idea\n",
      "what those children did for him, eventually. I donât think he was mad,\n",
      "but only terribly unhappy. But Iâll tell you all about him another day.\n",
      "Now I must get on with this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe children did not love me at first; I was such a sickly, awkward\n",
      "kind of a fellow thenâand I know I am ugly. Besides, I was a foreigner.\n",
      "The children used to laugh at me, at first; and they even went so far\n",
      "as to throw stones at me, when they saw me kiss Marie. I only kissed\n",
      "her once in my lifeâno, no, donât laugh!â The prince hastened to\n",
      "suppress the smiles of his audience at this point. âIt was not a matter\n",
      "of _love_ at all! If only you knew what a miserable creature she was,\n",
      "you would have pitied her, just as I did. She belonged to our village.\n",
      "Her mother was an old, old woman, and they used to sell string and\n",
      "thread, and soap and tobacco, out of the window of their little house,\n",
      "and lived on the pittance they gained by this trade. The old woman was\n",
      "ill and very old, and could hardly move. Marie was her daughter, a girl\n",
      "of twenty, weak and thin and consumptive; but still she did heavy work\n",
      "at the houses around, day by day. Well, one fine day a commercial\n",
      "traveller betrayed her and carried her off; and a week later he\n",
      "deserted her. She came home dirty, draggled, and shoeless; she had\n",
      "walked for a whole week without shoes; she had slept in the fields, and\n",
      "caught a terrible cold; her feet were swollen and sore, and her hands\n",
      "torn and scratched all over. She never had been pretty even before; but\n",
      "her eyes were quiet, innocent, kind eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "âShe was very quiet alwaysâand I remember once, when she had suddenly\n",
      "begun singing at her work, everyone said, âMarie tried to sing today!â\n",
      "and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after. She had been\n",
      "treated kindly in the place before; but when she came back nowâill and\n",
      "shunned and miserableânot one of them all had the slightest sympathy\n",
      "for her. Cruel people! Oh, what hazy understandings they have on such\n",
      "matters! Her mother was the first to show the way. She received her\n",
      "wrathfully, unkindly, and with contempt. âYou have disgraced me,â she\n",
      "said. She was the first to cast her into ignominy; but when they all\n",
      "heard that Marie had returned to the village, they ran out to see her\n",
      "and crowded into the little cottageâold men, children, women,\n",
      "girlsâsuch a hurrying, stamping, greedy crowd. Marie was lying on the\n",
      "floor at the old womanâs feet, hungry, torn, draggled, crying,\n",
      "miserable.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhen everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her\n",
      "dishevelled hair and lay cowering on the floor. Everyone looked at her\n",
      "as though she were a piece of dirt off the road. The old men scolded\n",
      "and condemned, and the young ones laughed at her. The women condemned\n",
      "her too, and looked at her contemptuously, just as though she were some\n",
      "loathsome insect.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHer mother allowed all this to go on, and nodded her head and\n",
      "encouraged them. The old woman was very ill at that time, and knew she\n",
      "was dying (she really did die a couple of months later), and though she\n",
      "felt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter,\n",
      "to the very day of her death. She would not even speak to her. She made\n",
      "her sleep on straw in a shed, and hardly gave her food enough to\n",
      "support life.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMarie was very gentle to her mother, and nursed her, and did\n",
      "everything for her; but the old woman accepted all her services without\n",
      "a word and never showed her the slightest kindness. Marie bore all\n",
      "this; and I could see when I got to know her that she thought it quite\n",
      "right and fitting, considering herself the lowest and meanest of\n",
      "creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhen the old woman took to her bed finally, the other old women in the\n",
      "village sat with her by turns, as the custom is there; and then Marie\n",
      "was quite driven out of the house. They gave her no food at all, and\n",
      "she could not get any work in the village; none would employ her. The\n",
      "men seemed to consider her no longer a woman, they said such dreadful\n",
      "things to her. Sometimes on Sundays, if they were drunk enough, they\n",
      "used to throw her a penny or two, into the mud, and Marie would\n",
      "silently pick up the money. She had began to spit blood at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAt last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of\n",
      "appearing in the village any longer. The children used to pelt her with\n",
      "mud; so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd, but the cowherd\n",
      "would not have her. Then she took to helping him without leave; and he\n",
      "saw how valuable her assistance was to him, and did not drive her away\n",
      "again; on the contrary, he occasionally gave her the remnants of his\n",
      "dinner, bread and cheese. He considered that he was being very kind.\n",
      "When the mother died, the village parson was not ashamed to hold Marie\n",
      "up to public derision and shame. Marie was standing at the coffinâs\n",

      "\n",
      "âA crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry. The parson,\n",

      "ill for at least two years)ââthere she stands before you, and dares not\n",
      "lift her eyes from the ground, because she knows that the finger of God\n",
      "is upon her. Look at her tatters and ragsâthe badge of those who lose\n",
      "their virtue. Who is she? her daughter!â and so on to the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them, nearly. Only\n",

      "learned to love Marie.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis is how it was: I had wished to do something for Marie; I longed\n",
      "to give her some money, but I never had a farthing while I was there.\n",
      "But I had a little diamond pin, and this I sold to a travelling pedlar;\n",
      "he gave me eight francs for itâit was worth at least forty.\n",

      "kissed her and said that she was not to suppose I kissed her with any\n",
      "evil motives or because I was in love with her, for that I did so\n",
      "solely out of pity for her, and because from the first I had not\n",
      "accounted her as guilty so much as unfortunate. I longed to console and\n",
      "encourage her somehow, and to assure her that she was not the low, base\n",
      "thing which she and others strove to make out; but I donât think she\n",
      "understood me. She stood before me, dreadfully ashamed of herself, and\n",
      "with downcast eyes; and when I had finished she kissed my hand. I would\n",
      "have kissed hers, but she drew it away. Just at this moment the whole\n",
      "troop of children saw us. (I found out afterwards that they had long\n",
      "kept a watch upon me.) They all began whistling and clapping their\n",
      "hands, and laughing at us. Marie ran away at once; and when I tried to\n",
      "talk to them, they threw stones at me. All the village heard of it the\n",
      "same day, and Marieâs position became worse than ever. The children\n",
      "would not let her pass now in the streets, but annoyed her and threw\n",
      "dirt at her more than before. They used to run after herâshe racing\n",
      "away with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping, and they pelting\n",
      "her and shouting abuse at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOnce I had to interfere by force; and after that I took to speaking to\n",
      "them every day and whenever I could. Occasionally they stopped and\n",
      "listened; but they teased Marie all the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while they stopped\n",
      "their abuse of her, and let her go by silently. Little by little we got\n",
      "into the way of conversing together, the children and I. I concealed\n",
      "nothing from them, I told them all. They listened very attentively and\n",
      "soon began to be sorry for Marie. At last some of them took to saying\n",
      "âGood-morningâ to her, kindly, when they met her. It is the custom\n",
      "there to salute anyone you meet with âGood-morningâ whether acquainted\n",
      "or not. I can imagine how astonished Marie was at these first greetings\n",
      "from the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOnce two little girls got hold of some food and took it to her, and\n",
      "came back and told me. They said she had burst into tears, and that\n",
      "they loved her very much now. Very soon after that they all became fond\n",
      "of Marie, and at the same time they began to develop the greatest\n",
      "affection for myself. They often came to me and begged me to tell them\n",
      "stories. I think I must have told stories well, for they did so love to\n",
      "hear them. At last I took to reading up interesting things on purpose\n",
      "to pass them on to the little ones, and this went on for all the rest\n",
      "of my time there, three years. Later, when everyoneâeven Schneiderâwas\n",
      "angry with me for hiding nothing from the children, I pointed out how\n",
      "foolish it was, for they always knew things, only they learnt them in a\n",
      "way that soiled their minds but not so from me. One has only to\n",
      "remember oneâs own childhood to admit the truth of this. But nobody was\n",

      "full of simplicity. The contrast aroused a deep sympathy in his heart\n",

      "and calm astonishment as she had shown a little while before, when the\n",
      "prince handed her the note, and it appeared that this calm surprise and\n",
      "seemingly absolute incomprehension of what was said to her, were more\n",
      "terribly overwhelming to Gania than even the most plainly expressed\n",
      "disdain would have been.\n",
      "\n",

      "too good for a clerk on two thousand roubles a year. But it was\n",

      "request of his mother and his sister, Varvara Ardalionovna, who longed\n",
      "to do something to increase the family income a little, and fixed their\n",

      "afterwardsâthat society in which he had been accustomed to pose up to\n",
      "now as a young man of rather brilliant prospects. All these concessions\n",
      "and rebuffs of fortune, of late, had wounded his spirit severely, and\n",
      "his temper had become extremely irritable, his wrath being generally\n",

      "difficulties than he had had before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flat was divided by a passage which led straight out of the\n",

      "up or down the back stairs. Colia, Ganiaâs young brother, a school-boy\n",
      "of thirteen, shared this room with his father. He, too, had to sleep on\n",

      "Ganiaâs study in the evening, and his bedroom at night; and lastly Nina\n",

      "\n",
      "In a word, the whole place was confined, and a âtight fitâ for the\n",

      "considerable firmness and decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her dress was modest and simple to a degree, dark and elderly in style;\n",

      "of passionate regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very like her mother: she even dressed like her, which proved\n",
      "that she had no taste for smart clothes. The expression of her grey\n",

      "thought and anxiety. The same decision and firmness was to be observed\n",
      "in her face as in her motherâs, but her strength seemed to be more\n",
      "vigorous than that of Nina Alexandrovna. She was subject to outbursts\n",
      "of temper, of which even her brother was a little afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The present visitor, Ptitsin, was also afraid of her. This was a young\n",
      "fellow of something under thirty, dressed plainly, but neatly. His\n",
      "manners were good, but rather ponderously so. His dark beard bore\n",
      "evidence to the fact that he was not in any government employ. He could\n",
      "speak well, but preferred silence. On the whole he made a decidedly\n",
      "agreeable impression. He was clearly attracted by Varvara, and made no\n",
      "secret of his feelings. She trusted him in a friendly way, but had not\n",
      "shown him any decided encouragement as yet, which fact did not quell\n",
      "his ardour in the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nina Alexandrovna was very fond of him, and had grown quite\n",
      "confidential with him of late. Ptitsin, as was well known, was engaged\n",
      "in the business of lending out money on good security, and at a good\n",

      "Kolpakoff, stole some leather from one of his comrades, intending to\n",
      "sell it, and spent the money on drink. Well! The princeâyou understand\n",
      "that what follows took place in the presence of the sergeant-major, and\n",
      "a corporalâthe prince rated Kolpakoff soundly, and threatened to have\n",
      "him flogged. Well, Kolpakoff went back to the barracks, lay down on a\n",
      "camp bedstead, and in a quarter of an hour was dead: you quite\n",

      "\n",
      "âIt did not occurâitâs a mistake!â said Nina Alexandrovna quickly,\n",
      "looking, at the prince rather anxiously. â_Mon mari se trompe_,â she\n",

      "One thing I must beg of youâif my husband applies to you for payment\n",
      "for board and lodging, tell him that you have already paid me. Of\n",

      "\n",
      "âThis evening!â repeated her mother in a tone of despair, but softly,\n",
      "as though to herself. âThen itâs all settled, of course, and thereâs no\n",
      "hope left to us. She has anticipated her answer by the present of her\n",

      "\n",
      "âYou know we have hardly spoken to each other for a whole month.\n",

      "\n",
      "âPrince,â asked Nina Alexandrovna, âI wanted to inquire whether you\n",

      "from somewhere.â\n",
      "\n",

      "seated next to her, but Varia moved to the other end of the room; the\n",
      "portrait of Nastasia Philipovna remained lying as before on the\n",
      "work-table. Gania observed it there, and with a frown of annoyance\n",
      "snatched it up and threw it across to his writing-table, which stood at\n",
      "the other end of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs it today, Gania?â asked Nina Alexandrovna, at last.\n",

      "know that. I have submitted to my fate; but my heart will always be\n",
      "with you, whether we remain united, or whether we part. Of course I\n",

      "âI was not going to express myself so. But how could you so blind her?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Nina Alexandrovnaâs question betrayed intense annoyance. Gania waited a\n",

      "of his tone:\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere you are, mother, you are always like that. You begin by\n",

      "the subjectâwe had, really. I shall never leave you, mother; any other\n",

      "looking at me at this moment! Besides, how do you know that I am\n",
      "blinding Nastasia Philipovna? As for Varia, I donât careâshe can do\n",
      "just as she pleases. There, thatâs quite enough!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Ganiaâs irritation increased with every word he uttered, as he walked\n",

      "\n",
      "âI have said already that the moment she comes in I go out, and I shall\n",

      "\n",
      "Nastasiaâs arrival was a most unexpected and overwhelming event to all\n",
      "parties. In the first place, she had never been before. Up to now she\n",
      "had been so haughty that she had never even asked Gania to introduce\n",
      "her to his parents. Of late she had not so much as mentioned them.\n",

      "\n",
      "He would have borne anything from her rather than this visit. But one\n",
      "thing seemed to him quite clearâher visit now, and the present of her\n",

      "kept her gloomy expression. She did not even vouchsafe the usual\n",
      "courteous smile of etiquette. Gania darted a terrible glance of wrath\n",
      "at her for this, but Nina Alexandrovna mended matters a little when\n",
      "Gania introduced her at last. Hardly, however, had the old lady begun\n",
      "about her âhighly gratified feelings,â and so on, when Nastasia left\n",
      "her, and flounced into a chair by Ganiaâs side in the corner by the\n",

      "You do take in lodgers, donât you?â\n",

      "\n",
      "âWell, it is troublesome, rather,â said the latter; âbut I suppose it\n",

      "Again Nastasia Philipovna did not hear the sentence out. She glanced at\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It was clear that he came out with these words quite spontaneously, on\n",
      "the spur of the moment. But his speech was productive of muchâfor it\n",
      "appeared that all Ganiaâs rage now overflowed upon the prince. He\n",
      "seized him by the shoulder and gazed with an intensity of loathing and\n",
      "revenge at him, but said nothingâas though his feelings were too strong\n",
      "to permit of words.\n",
      "\n",
      "General agitation prevailed. Nina Alexandrovna gave a little cry of\n",

      "watching the scene from under her eyelashes. She did not sit down, but\n",
      "stood by her mother with folded hands. However, Gania recollected\n",
      "himself almost immediately. He let go of the prince and burst out\n",
      "laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, are you a doctor, prince, or what?â he asked, as naturally as\n",
      "possible. âI declare you quite frightened me! Nastasia Philipovna, let\n",

      "is he, did you say? What prince? Muishkin?â she added, addressing\n",
      "Gania.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe is a lodger of ours,â explained the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAn idiot!ââthe prince distinctly heard the word half whispered from\n",

      "fail to restrain her laughter over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI was astonished, seeing you so suddenlyââ murmured the prince.\n",

      "Rogojin told me a good deal about you; and at the very moment that I\n",

      "\n",

      "prince and Nastasia Philipovna, divided the crowd, as it were, and\n",
      "before them stood the head of the family, General Ivolgin. He was\n",
      "dressed in evening clothes; his moustache was dyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This apparition was too much for Gania. Vain and ambitious almost to\n",

      "was seeking feverishly for some means of enabling himself to lead a\n",
      "more presentable kind of existence. At home, he now adopted an attitude\n",
      "of absolute cynicism, but he could not keep this up before Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna, although he had sworn to make her pay after marriage for\n",
      "all he suffered now. He was experiencing a last humiliation, the\n",
      "bitterest of all, at this momentâthe humiliation of blushing for his\n",
      "own kindred in his own house. A question flashed through his mind as to\n",
      "whether the game was really worth the candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "For that had happened at this moment, which for two months had been his\n",
      "nightmare; which had filled his soul with dread and shameâthe meeting\n",
      "between his father and Nastasia Philipovna. He had often tried to\n",
      "imagine such an event, but had found the picture too mortifying and\n",
      "exasperating, and had quietly dropped it. Very likely he anticipated\n",
      "far worse things than was at all necessary; it is often so with vain\n",
      "persons. He had long since determined, therefore, to get his father out\n",
      "of the way, anywhere, before his marriage, in order to avoid such a\n",
      "meeting; but when Nastasia entered the room just now, he had been so\n",
      "overwhelmed with astonishment, that he had not thought of his father,\n",
      "and had made no arrangements to keep him out of the way. And now it was\n",
      "too lateâthere he was, and got up, too, in a dress coat and white tie,\n",
      "and Nastasia in the very humour to heap ridicule on him and his family\n",
      "circle; of this last fact, he felt quite persuaded. What else had she\n",
      "come for? There were his mother and his sister sitting before her, and\n",
      "she seemed to have forgotten their very existence already; and if she\n",

      "difficult thing to put this warrior to confusion, and his sudden\n",

      "âSheâah, thatâs where all the mischief of it lies!â replied Ivolgin,\n",
      "frowning. âWithout a word, as it were, of warning, she slapped me on\n",

      "âNo, oh no!âthere was a great flare-up, but I didnât hit her! I had to\n",
      "struggle a little, purely to defend myself; but the very devil was in\n",
      "the business. It turned out that âlight blueâ was an Englishwoman,\n",
      "governess or something, at Princess Bielokonskiâs, and the other woman\n",
      "was one of the old-maid princesses Bielokonski. Well, everybody knows\n",
      "what great friends the princess and Mrs. Epanchin are, so there was a\n",
      "pretty kettle of fish. All the Bielokonskis went into mourning for the\n",

      "\n",

      "âBut wait,â said Nastasia. âHow is it that, five or six days since, I\n",
      "read exactly the same story in the paper, as happening between a\n",
      "Frenchman and an English girl? The cigar was snatched away exactly as\n",
      "you describe, and the poodle was chucked out of the window after it.\n",

      "\n",
      "X.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrance-hall suddenly became full of noise and people. To judge\n",
      "from the sounds which penetrated to the drawing-room, a number of\n",
      "people had already come in, and the stampede continued. Several voices\n",
      "were talking and shouting at once; others were talking and shouting on\n",
      "the stairs outside; it was evidently a most extraordinary visit that\n",
      "was about to take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone exchanged startled glances. Gania rushed out towards the\n",

      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh! here he is, the Judas!â cried a voice which the prince recognized\n",
      "at once. âHow dâye do, Gania, you old blackguard?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, thatâs the man!â said another voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no room for doubt in the princeâs mind: one of the voices was\n",
      "Rogojinâs, and the other Lebedeffâs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania stood at the door like a block and looked on in silence, putting\n",
      "no obstacle in the way of their entrance, and ten or a dozen men\n",
      "marched in behind Parfen Rogojin. They were a decidedly mixed-looking\n",
      "collection, and some of them came in in their furs and caps. None of\n",
      "them were quite drunk, but all appeared to be considerably excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed to need each otherâs support, morally, before they dared\n",
      "come in; not one of them would have entered alone but with the rest\n",
      "each one was brave enough. Even Rogojin entered rather cautiously at\n",
      "the head of his troop; but he was evidently preoccupied. He appeared to\n",
      "be gloomy and morose, and had clearly come with some end in view. All\n",
      "the rest were merely chorus, brought in to support the chief character.\n",
      "Besides Lebedeff there was the dandy Zalesheff, who came in without his\n",
      "coat and hat, two or three others followed his example; the rest were\n",
      "more uncouth. They included a couple of young merchants, a man in a\n",
      "great-coat, a medical student, a little Pole, a small fat man who\n",
      "laughed continuously, and an enormously tall stout one who apparently\n",
      "put great faith in the strength of his fists. A couple of âladiesâ of\n",
      "some sort put their heads in at the front door, but did not dare come\n",
      "any farther. Colia promptly banged the door in their faces and locked\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHallo, Gania, you blackguard! You didnât expect Rogojin, eh?â said the\n",
      "latter, entering the drawing-room, and stopping before Gania.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at this moment he saw, seated before him, Nastasia Philipovna. He\n",
      "had not dreamed of meeting her here, evidently, for her appearance\n",
      "produced a marvellous effect upon him. He grew pale, and his lips\n",
      "became actually blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI suppose it is true, then!â he muttered to himself, and his face took\n",
      "on an expression of despair. âSo thatâs the end of it! Now you, sir,\n",
      "will you answer me or not?â he went on suddenly, gazing at Gania with\n",
      "ineffable malice. âNow then, youââ\n",
      "\n",
      "He panted, and could hardly speak for agitation. He advanced into the\n",
      "room mechanically; but perceiving Nina Alexandrovna and Varia he became\n",
      "more or less embarrassed, in spite of his excitement. His followers\n",
      "entered after him, and all paused a moment at sight of the ladies. Of\n",
      "course their modesty was not fated to be long-lived, but for a moment\n",
      "they were abashed. Once let them begin to shout, however, and nothing\n",
      "on earth should disconcert them.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat, you here too, prince?â said Rogojin, absently, but a little\n",
      "surprised all the same âStill in your gaiters, eh?â He sighed, and\n",
      "forgot the prince next moment, and his wild eyes wandered over to\n",
      "Nastasia again, as though attracted in that direction by some magnetic\n",
      "force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia looked at the new arrivals with great curiosity. Gania\n",
      "recollected himself at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "âExcuse me, sirs,â he said, loudly, âbut what does all this mean?â He\n",
      "glared at the advancing crowd generally, but addressed his remarks\n",
      "especially to their captain, Rogojin. âYou are not in a stable,\n",
      "gentlemen, though you may think itâmy mother and sister are present.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, I see your mother and sister,â muttered Rogojin, through his\n",
      "teeth; and Lebedeff seemed to feel himself called upon to second the\n",
      "statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAt all events, I must request you to step into the salon,â said Gania,\n",
      "his rage rising quite out of proportion to his words, âand then I shall\n",
      "inquireââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat, he doesnât know me!â said Rogojin, showing his teeth\n",
      "disagreeably. âHe doesnât recognize Rogojin!â He did not move an inch,\n",
      "however.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have met you somewhere, I believe, butââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âMet me somewhere, pfu! Why, itâs only three months since I lost two\n",
      "hundred roubles of my fatherâs money to you, at cards. The old fellow\n",
      "died before he found out. Ptitsin knows all about it. Why, Iâve only to\n",
      "pull out a three-rouble note and show it to you, and youâd crawl on\n",
      "your hands and knees to the other end of the town for it; thatâs the\n",
      "sort of man you are. Why, Iâve come now, at this moment, to buy you up!\n",
      "Oh, you neednât think that because I wear these boots I have no money.\n",
      "I have lots of money, my beauty,âenough to buy up you and all yours\n",
      "together. So I shall, if I like to! Iâll buy you up! I will!â he\n",
      "yelled, apparently growing more and more intoxicated and excited. âOh,\n",

      "to marry this man, or not?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin asked his question like a lost soul appealing to some divinity,\n",

      "\n",
      "He awaited the reply in deadly anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna gazed at him with a haughty, ironical expression of\n",
      "face; but when she glanced at Nina Alexandrovna and Varia, and from\n",
      "them to Gania, she changed her tone, all of a sudden.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCertainly not; what are you thinking of? What could have induced you\n",
      "to ask such a question?â she replied, quietly and seriously, and even,\n",
      "apparently, with some astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo? No?â shouted Rogojin, almost out of his mind with joy. âYou are\n",
      "not going to, after all? And they told meâoh, Nastasia Philipovnaâthey\n",
      "said you had promised to marry him, _him!_ As if you _could_ do\n",
      "it!âhimâpooh! I donât mind saying it to everyoneâIâd buy him off for a\n",
      "hundred roubles, any day pfu! Give him a thousand, or three if he\n",
      "likes, poor devil, and heâd cut and run the day before his wedding, and\n",
      "leave his bride to me! Wouldnât you, Gania, you blackguard? Youâd take\n",
      "three thousand, wouldnât you? Hereâs the money! Look, Iâve come on\n",
      "purpose to pay you off and get your receipt, formally. I said Iâd buy\n",
      "you up, and so I will.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âGet out of this, you drunken beast!â cried Gania, who was red and\n",
      "white by turns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojinâs troop, who were only waiting for an excuse, set up a howl at\n",
      "this. Lebedeff stepped forward and whispered something in Parfenâs ear.\n",

      "âYouâre right, clerk,â said the latter, âyouâre right, tipsy\n",
      "spiritâyouâre right!âNastasia Philipovna,â he added, looking at her\n",
      "like some lunatic, harmless generally, but suddenly wound up to a pitch\n",
      "of audacity, âhere are eighteen thousand roubles, andâand you shall\n",
      "have moreâ.â Here he threw a packet of bank-notes tied up in white\n",
      "paper, on the table before her, not daring to say all he wished to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNoânoâno!â muttered Lebedeff, clutching at his arm. He was clearly\n",
      "aghast at the largeness of the sum, and thought a far smaller amount\n",
      "should have been tried first.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, you foolâyou donât know whom you are dealing withâand it appears I\n",
      "am a fool, too!â said Parfen, trembling beneath the flashing glance of\n",
      "Nastasia. âOh, curse it all! What a fool I was to listen to you!â he\n",
      "added, with profound melancholy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna, observing his woe-begone expression, suddenly\n",
      "burst out laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âEighteen thousand roubles, for me? Why, you declare yourself a fool at\n",
      "once,â she said, with impudent familiarity, as she rose from the sofa\n",
      "and prepared to go. Gania watched the whole scene with a sinking of the\n",
      "heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "âForty thousand, thenâforty thousand roubles instead of eighteen!\n",

      "and Varia had both risen from their places and were waiting, in silent\n",
      "horror, to see what would happen. Variaâs eyes were all ablaze with\n",
      "anger; but the scene had a different effect on Nina Alexandrovna. She\n",
      "paled and trembled, and looked more and more like fainting every\n",
      "moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "âVery well then, a _hundred_ thousand! a hundred thousand! paid this\n",
      "very day. Ptitsin! find it for me. A good share shall stick to your\n",
      "fingersâcome!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are mad!â said Ptitsin, coming up quickly and seizing him by the\n",

      "Think where you are.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, heâs boasting like a drunkard,â added Nastasia, as though with\n",

      "âI do _not_ boast! You shall have a hundred thousand, this very day.\n",
      "Ptitsin, get the money, you gay usurer! Take what you like for it, but\n",
      "get it by the evening! Iâll show that Iâm in earnest!â cried Rogojin,\n",
      "working himself up into a frenzy of excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome, come; whatâs all this?â cried General Ivolgin, suddenly and\n",
      "angrily, coming close up to Rogojin. The unexpectedness of this sally\n",
      "on the part of the hitherto silent old man caused some laughter among\n",
      "the intruders.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHalloa! whatâs this now?â laughed Rogojin. âYou come along with me,\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, itâs too horrible!â cried poor Colia, sobbing with shame and\n",

      "\n",
      "âSurely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this\n",
      "shameless creature out of the room?â cried Varia, suddenly. She was\n",
      "shaking and trembling with rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs me, I suppose. Iâm the shameless creature!â cried Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna, with amused indifference. âDear me, and I cameâlike a fool,\n",
      "as I amâto invite them over to my house for the evening! Look how your\n",
      "sister treats me, Gavrila Ardalionovitch.â\n",
      "\n",
      "For some moments Gania stood as if stunned or struck by lightning,\n",
      "after his sisterâs speech. But seeing that Nastasia Philipovna was\n",
      "really about to leave the room this time, he sprang at Varia and seized\n",
      "her by the arm like a madman.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat have you done?â he hissed, glaring at her as though he would like\n",
      "to annihilate her on the spot. He was quite beside himself, and could\n",

      "defiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few moments passed as they stood there face to face, Gania still\n",
      "holding her wrist tightly. Varia struggled onceâtwiceâto get free; then\n",
      "could restrain herself no longer, and spat in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThereâs a girl for you!â cried Nastasia Philipovna. âMr. Ptitsin, I\n",
      "congratulate you on your choice.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania lost his head. Forgetful of everything he aimed a blow at Varia,\n",

      "caught his. Between him and Varia stood the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âEnoughâenough!â said the latter, with insistence, but all of a tremble\n",
      "with excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAre you going to cross my path for ever, damn you!â cried Gania; and,\n",
      "loosening his hold on Varia, he slapped the princeâs face with all his\n",
      "force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exclamations of horror arose on all sides. The prince grew pale as\n",
      "death; he gazed into Ganiaâs eyes with a strange, wild, reproachful\n",
      "look; his lips trembled and vainly endeavoured to form some words; then\n",
      "his mouth twisted into an incongruous smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âVery wellânever mind about me; but I shall not allow you to strike\n",
      "her!â he said, at last, quietly. Then, suddenly, he could bear it no\n",
      "longer, and covering his face with his hands, turned to the wall, and\n",
      "murmured in broken accents:\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh! how ashamed you will be of this afterwards!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania certainly did look dreadfully abashed. Colia rushed up to comfort\n",

      "general.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs nothing, itâs nothing!â said the prince, and again he wore the\n",
      "smile which was so inconsistent with the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, he will be ashamed!â cried Rogojin. âYou will be properly ashamed\n",
      "of yourself for having injured such aâsuch a sheepâ (he could not find\n",
      "a better word). âPrince, my dear fellow, leave this and come away with\n",

      "reproach, which evidently came from his very heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna looked surprised, and smiled, but evidently\n",
      "concealed something beneath her smile and with some confusion and a\n",
      "glance at Gania she left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, she had not reached the outer hall when she turned round,\n",
      "walked quickly up to Nina Alexandrovna, seized her hand and lifted it\n",
      "to her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe guessed quite right. I am not that sort of woman,â she whispered\n",
      "hurriedly, flushing red all over. Then she turned again and left the\n",
      "room so quickly that no one could imagine what she had come back for.\n",
      "All they saw was that she said something to Nina Alexandrovna in a\n",
      "hurried whisper, and seemed to kiss her hand. Varia, however, both saw\n",
      "and heard all, and watched Nastasia out of the room with an expression\n",
      "of wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania recollected himself in time to rush after her in order to show\n",
      "her out, but she had gone. He followed her to the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDonât come with me,â she cried, â_Au revoir_, till the eveningâdo you\n",
      "hear? _Au revoir!_â\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned thoughtful and confused; the riddle lay heavier than ever\n",
      "on his soul. He was troubled about the prince, too, and so bewildered\n",
      "that he did not even observe Rogojinâs rowdy band crowd past him and\n",
      "step on his toes, at the door as they went out. They were all talking\n",
      "at once. Rogojin went ahead of the others, talking to Ptitsin, and\n",
      "apparently insisting vehemently upon something very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYouâve lost the game, Ganiaâ he cried, as he passed the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania gazed after him uneasily, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "XI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince now left the room and shut himself up in his own chamber.\n",
      "Colia followed him almost at once, anxious to do what he could to\n",
      "console him. The poor boy seemed to be already so attached to him that\n",
      "he could hardly leave him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou were quite right to go away!â he said. âThe row will rage there\n",
      "worse than ever now; and itâs like this every day with usâand all\n",
      "through that Nastasia Philipovna.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou have so many sources of trouble here, Colia,â said the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, indeed, and it is all our own fault. But I have a great friend\n",
      "who is much worse off even than we are. Would you like to know him?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, very much. Is he one of your school-fellows?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, not exactly. I will tell you all about him some day.... What do\n",
      "you think of Nastasia Philipovna? She is beautiful, isnât she? I had\n",
      "never seen her before, though I had a great wish to do so. She\n",
      "fascinated me. I could forgive Gania if he were to marry her for love,\n",
      "but for money! Oh dear! that is horrible!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, your brother does not attract me much.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am not surprised at that. After what you... But I do hate that way\n",
      "of looking at things! Because some fool, or a rogue pretending to be a\n",
      "fool, strikes a man, that man is to be dishonoured for his whole life,\n",
      "unless he wipes out the disgrace with blood, or makes his assailant beg\n",
      "forgiveness on his knees! I think that so very absurd and tyrannical.\n",
      "Lermontoffâs Bal Masque is based on that ideaâa stupid and unnatural\n",
      "one, in my opinion; but he was hardly more than a child when he wrote\n",
      "it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI like your sister very much.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDid you see how she spat in Ganiaâs face! Varia is afraid of no one.\n",
      "But you did not follow her example, and yet I am sure it was not\n",
      "through cowardice. Here she comes! Speak of a wolf and you see his\n",
      "tail! I felt sure that she would come. She is very generous, though of\n",
      "course she has her faults.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Varia pounced upon her brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis is not the place for you,â said she. âGo to father. Is he\n",
      "plaguing you, prince?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNot in the least; on the contrary, he interests me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âScolding as usual, Varia! It is the worst thing about her. After all,\n",
      "I believe father may have started off with Rogojin. No doubt he is\n",
      "sorry now. Perhaps I had better go and see what he is doing,â added\n",
      "Colia, running off.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThank God, I have got mother away, and put her to bed without another\n",

      "spectacle! I have come to thank you once more, prince, and to ask you\n",
      "if you knew Nastasia Philipovna before?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, I have never known her.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen what did you mean, when you said straight out to her that she was\n",
      "not really âlike thatâ? You guessed right, I fancy. It is quite\n",
      "possible she was not herself at the moment, though I cannot fathom her\n",
      "meaning. Evidently she meant to hurt and insult us. I have heard\n",
      "curious tales about her before now, but if she came to invite us to her\n",
      "house, why did she behave so to my mother? Ptitsin knows her very well;\n",
      "he says he could not understand her today. With Rogojin, too! No one\n",
      "with a spark of self-respect could have talked like that in the house\n",
      "of her... Mother is extremely vexed on your account, too...\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat is nothing!â said the prince, waving his hand.\n",

      "\n",
      "âMeek! What do you mean?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou told her it was a shame for her to behave so, and her manner\n",
      "changed at once; she was like another person. You have some influence\n",
      "over her, prince,â added Varia, smiling a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door opened at this point, and in came Gania most unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not in the least disconcerted to see Varia there, but he stood a\n",
      "moment at the door, and then approached the prince quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPrince,â he said, with feeling, âI was a blackguard. Forgive me!â His\n",
      "face gave evidence of suffering. The prince was considerably amazed,\n",
      "and did not reply at once. âOh, come, forgive me, forgive me!â Gania\n",
      "insisted, rather impatiently. âIf you like, Iâll kiss your hand.\n",
      "There!â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was touched; he took Ganiaâs hands, and embraced him\n",
      "heartily, while each kissed the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI never, never thought you were like that,â said Muishkin, drawing a\n",
      "deep breath. âI thought youâyou werenât capable ofââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf what? Apologizing, eh? And where on earth did I get the idea that\n",
      "you were an idiot? You always observe what other people pass by\n",
      "unnoticed; one could talk sense to you, butââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âHere is another to whom you should apologize,â said the prince,\n",
      "pointing to Varia.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, no! they are all enemies! Iâve tried them often enough, believe\n",
      "me,â and Gania turned his back on Varia with these words.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut if I beg you to make it up?â said Varia.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd youâll go to Nastasia Philipovnaâs this eveningââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf you insist: but, judge for yourself, can I go, ought I to go?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut she is not that sort of woman, I tell you!â said Gania, angrily.\n",
      "âShe was only acting.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI know thatâI know that; but what a part to play! And think what she\n",
      "must take _you_ for, Gania! I know she kissed motherâs hand, and all\n",
      "that, but she laughed at you, all the same. All this is not good enough\n",
      "for seventy-five thousand roubles, my dear boy. You are capable of\n",
      "honourable feelings still, and thatâs why I am talking to you so. Oh!\n",
      "_do_ take care what you are doing! Donât you know yourself that it will\n",
      "end badly, Gania?â\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, and in a state of violent agitation, Varia left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere, they are all like that,â said Gania, laughing, âjust as if I do\n",
      "not know all about it much better than they do.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down with these words, evidently intending to prolong his visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf you know it so well,â said the prince a little timidly, âwhy do you\n",
      "choose all this worry for the sake of the seventy-five thousand, which,\n",
      "you confess, does not cover it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI didnât mean that,â said Gania; âbut while we are upon the subject,\n",
      "let me hear your opinion. Is all this worry worth seventy-five thousand\n",
      "or not?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âCertainly not.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course! And it would be a disgrace to marry so, eh?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âA great disgrace.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, well, then you may know that I shall certainly do it, now. I shall\n",
      "certainly marry her. I was not quite sure of myself before, but now I\n",
      "am. Donât say a word: I know what you want to tell meââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo. I was only going to say that what surprises me most of all is your\n",
      "extraordinary confidence.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow so? What in?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat Nastasia Philipovna will accept you, and that the question is as\n",
      "good as settled; and secondly, that even if she did, you would be able\n",
      "to pocket the money. Of course, I know very little about it, but thatâs\n",
      "my view. When a man marries for money it often happens that the wife\n",
      "keeps the money in her own hands.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course, you donât know all; but, I assure you, you neednât be\n",
      "afraid, it wonât be like that in our case. There are circumstances,â\n",
      "said Gania, rather excitedly. âAnd as to her answer to me, thereâs no\n",
      "doubt about that. Why should you suppose she will refuse me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, I only judge by what I see. Varvara Ardalionovna said just nowââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh sheâthey donât know anything about it! Nastasia was only chaffing\n",
      "Rogojin. I was alarmed at first, but I have thought better of it now;\n",
      "she was simply laughing at him. She looks on me as a fool because I\n",
      "show that I meant her money, and doesnât realize that there are other\n",
      "men who would deceive her in far worse fashion. Iâm not going to\n",
      "pretend anything, and youâll see sheâll marry me, all right. If she\n",
      "likes to live quietly, so she shall; but if she gives me any of her\n",
      "nonsense, I shall leave her at once, but I shall keep the money. Iâm\n",
      "not going to look a fool; thatâs the first thing, not to look a fool.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut Nastasia Philipovna seems to me to be such a _sensible_ woman,\n",
      "and, as such, why should she run blindly into this business? Thatâs\n",
      "what puzzles me so,â said the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou donât know all, you see; I tell you there are thingsâand besides,\n",
      "Iâm sure that she is persuaded that I love her to distraction, and I\n",
      "give you my word I have a strong suspicion that she loves me, tooâin\n",
      "her own way, of course. She thinks she will be able to make a sort of\n",
      "slave of me all my life; but I shall prepare a little surprise for her.\n",
      "I donât know whether I ought to be confidential with you, prince; but,\n",
      "I assure you, you are the only decent fellow I have come across. I have\n",
      "not spoken so sincerely as I am doing at this moment for years. There\n",
      "are uncommonly few honest people about, prince; there isnât one\n",
      "honester than Ptitsin, heâs the best of the lot. Are you laughing? You\n",
      "donât know, perhaps, that blackguards like honest people, and being one\n",
      "myself I like you. _Why_ am I a blackguard? Tell me honestly, now. They\n",
      "all call me a blackguard because of her, and I have got into the way of\n",
      "thinking myself one. Thatâs what is so bad about the business.â\n",
      "\n",
      "â_I_ for one shall never think you a blackguard again,â said the\n",
      "prince. âI confess I had a poor opinion of you at first, but I have\n",
      "been so joyfully surprised about you just now; itâs a good lesson for\n",
      "me. I shall never judge again without a thorough trial. I see now that\n",
      "you are not only not a blackguard, but are not even quite spoiled. I\n",
      "see that you are quite an ordinary man, not original in the least\n",
      "degree, but rather weak.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania laughed sarcastically, but said nothing. The prince, seeing that\n",
      "he did not quite like the last remark, blushed, and was silent too.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHas my father asked you for money?â asked Gania, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDonât give it to him if he does. Fancy, he was a decent, respectable\n",
      "man once! He was received in the best society; he was not always the\n",
      "liar he is now. Of course, wine is at the bottom of it all; but he is a\n",
      "good deal worse than an innocent liar now. Do you know that he keeps a\n",
      "mistress? I canât understand how mother is so long-suffering. Did he\n",
      "tell you the story of the siege of Kars? Or perhaps the one about his\n",
      "grey horse that talked? He loves to enlarge on these absurd histories.â\n",
      "And Gania burst into a fit of laughter. Suddenly he turned to the\n",
      "prince and asked: âWhy are you looking at me like that?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am surprised to see you laugh in that way, like a child. You came to\n",
      "make friends with me again just now, and you said, âI will kiss your\n",
      "hand, if you like,â just as a child would have said it. And then, all\n",
      "at once you are talking of this mad projectâof these seventy-five\n",
      "thousand roubles! It all seems so absurd and impossible.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, what conclusion have you reached?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat you are rushing madly into the undertaking, and that you would do\n",
      "well to think it over again. It is more than possible that Varvara\n",
      "Ardalionovna is right.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh! now you begin to moralize! I know that I am only a child, very\n",
      "well,â replied Gania impatiently. âThat is proved by my having this\n",
      "conversation with you. It is not for money only, prince, that I am\n",
      "rushing into this affair,â he continued, hardly master of his words, so\n",
      "closely had his vanity been touched. âIf I reckoned on that I should\n",
      "certainly be deceived, for I am still too weak in mind and character. I\n",
      "am obeying a passion, an impulse perhaps, because I have but one aim,\n",
      "one that overmasters all else. You imagine that once I am in possession\n",
      "of these seventy-five thousand roubles, I shall rush to buy a\n",
      "carriage... No, I shall go on wearing the old overcoat I have worn for\n",
      "three years, and I shall give up my club. I shall follow the example of\n",
      "men who have made their fortunes. When Ptitsin was seventeen he slept\n",
      "in the street, he sold pen-knives, and began with a copeck; now he has\n",
      "sixty thousand roubles, but to get them, what has he not done? Well, I\n",
      "shall be spared such a hard beginning, and shall start with a little\n",
      "capital. In fifteen years people will say, âLook, thatâs Ivolgin, the\n",
      "king of the Jews!â You say that I have no originality. Now mark this,\n",
      "princeâthere is nothing so offensive to a man of our time and race than\n",
      "to be told that he is wanting in originality, that he is weak in\n",
      "character, has no particular talent, and is, in short, an ordinary\n",
      "person. You have not even done me the honour of looking upon me as a\n",
      "rogue. Do you know, I could have knocked you down for that just now!\n",
      "You wounded me more cruelly than Epanchin, who thinks me capable of\n",
      "selling him my wife! Observe, it was a perfectly gratuitous idea on his\n",
      "part, seeing there has never been any discussion of it between us! This\n",
      "has exasperated me, and I am determined to make a fortune! I will do\n",
      "it! Once I am rich, I shall be a genius, an extremely original man. One\n",
      "of the vilest and most hateful things connected with money is that it\n",
      "can buy even talent; and will do so as long as the world lasts. You\n",
      "will say that this is childishâor romantic. Well, that will be all the\n",
      "better for me, but the thing shall be done. I will carry it through. He\n",
      "laughs most, who laughs last. Why does Epanchin insult me? Simply\n",
      "because, socially, I am a nobody. However, enough for the present.\n",
      "Colia has put his nose in to tell us dinner is ready, twice. Iâm dining\n",
      "out. I shall come and talk to you now and then; you shall be\n",
      "comfortable enough with us. They are sure to make you one of the\n",
      "family. I think you and I will either be great friends or enemies. Look\n",
      "here now, supposing I had kissed your hand just now, as I offered to do\n",
      "in all sincerity, should I have hated you for it afterwards?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âCertainly, but not always. You would not have been able to keep it up,\n",
      "and would have ended by forgiving me,â said the prince, after a pause\n",
      "for reflection, and with a pleasant smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOho, how careful one has to be with you, prince! Havenât you put a\n",
      "drop of poison in that remark now, eh? By the wayâha, ha, ha!âI forgot\n",
      "to ask, was I right in believing that you were a good deal struck\n",
      "yourself with Nastasia Philipovna.â\n",

      "Believe it or not, as you like. You think she and Totskiânot a bit of\n",

      "\n",
      "Gania left the room in great good humour. The prince stayed behind, and\n",

      "angry, and said that anyone who did not call out a man who had given\n",
      "him a blow was a coward. He is very irritable to-day, and I left off\n",
      "arguing the matter with him. So Nastasia Philipovna has invited you to\n",

      "\n",
      "âTo tell the truth, she has not.â\n",

      "âI donât know, really, whether I shall be allowed in at all. If she\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âWell, whether you go on business or not is your affair, I do not want\n",

      "companyâcocottes, generals, usurers! If that were the case I should\n",
      "despise and laugh at you. There are terribly few honest people here,\n",

      "especially! Have you noticed, prince, how many adventurers there are\n",
      "nowadays? Especially here, in our dear Russia. How it has happened I\n",
      "never can understand. There used to be a certain amount of solidity in\n",
      "all things, but now what happens? Everything is exposed to the public\n",
      "gaze, veils are thrown back, every wound is probed by careless fingers.\n",
      "We are for ever present at an orgy of scandalous revelations. Parents\n",
      "blush when they remember their old-fashioned morality. At Moscow lately\n",
      "a father was heard urging his son to stop at nothingâat nothing, mind\n",
      "you!âto get money! The press seized upon the story, of course, and now\n",
      "it is public property. Look at my father, the general! See what he is,\n",
      "and yet, I assure you, he is an honest man! Only... he drinks too much,\n",
      "and his morals are not all we could desire. Yes, thatâs true! I pity\n",
      "him, to tell the truth, but I dare not say so, because everybody would\n",
      "laugh at meâbut I do pity him! And who are the really clever men, after\n",
      "all? Money-grubbers, every one of them, from the first to the last.\n",
      "Hippolyte finds excuses for money-lending, and says it is a necessity.\n",
      "He talks about the economic movement, and the ebb and flow of capital;\n",
      "the devil knows what he means. It makes me angry to hear him talk so,\n",

      "very high interest! Isnât it disgusting? And then, you would hardly\n",
      "believe it, but my motherâNina Alexandrovnaâhelps Hippolyte in all\n",
      "sorts of ways, sends him money and clothes. She even goes as far as\n",
      "helping the children, through Hippolyte, because their mother cares\n",
      "nothing about them, and Varia does the same.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, just now you said there were no honest nor good people about,\n",

      "Hippolyte, hardened as he is, feels it. He laughed at first, and\n",
      "thought it vulgar of herâbut now, he is sometimes quite touched and\n",
      "overcome by her kindness. Hâm! You call that being strong and good? I\n",

      "three live together? You, and I, and Hippolyte? We will hire a flat,\n",
      "and let the general come and visit us. What do you say?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt would be very pleasant,â returned the prince. âBut we must see. I\n",

      "success; we agree so entirely that I can do so, although I do not\n",
      "understand why you are here. Good-bye!â cried Colia excitedly. âNow I\n",
      "will rush back and tell Hippolyte all about our plans and proposals!\n",
      "But as to your getting inâdonât be in the least afraid. You will see\n",
      "her. She is so original about everything. Itâs the first floor. The\n",
      "porter will show you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "XIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was very nervous as he reached the outer door; but he did\n",
      "his best to encourage himself with the reflection that the worst thing\n",
      "that could happen to him would be that he would not be received, or,\n",
      "perhaps, received, then laughed at for coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was another question, which terrified him considerably, and\n",
      "that was: what was he going to do when he _did_ get in? And to this\n",
      "question he could fashion no satisfactory reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only he could find an opportunity of coming close up to Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna and saying to her: âDonât ruin yourself by marrying this\n",

      "himself, and so did Aglaya Ivanovna, and I have come on purpose to warn\n",
      "youââbut even that did not seem quite a legitimate or practicable thing\n",
      "to do. Then, again, there was another delicate question, to which he\n",
      "could not find an answer; dared not, in fact, think of it; but at the\n",
      "very idea of which he trembled and blushed. However, in spite of all\n",
      "his fears and heart-quakings he went in, and asked for Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia occupied a medium-sized, but distinctly tasteful, flat,\n",
      "beautifully furnished and arranged. At one period of these five years\n",
      "of Petersburg life, Totski had certainly not spared his expenditure\n",
      "upon her. He had calculated upon her eventual love, and tried to tempt\n",
      "her with a lavish outlay upon comforts and luxuries, knowing too well\n",
      "how easily the heart accustoms itself to comforts, and how difficult it\n",
      "is to tear oneâs self away from luxuries which have become habitual\n",
      "and, little by little, indispensable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia did not reject all this, she even loved her comforts and\n",
      "luxuries, but, strangely enough, never became, in the least degree,\n",
      "dependent upon them, and always gave the impression that she could do\n",
      "just as well without them. In fact, she went so far as to inform Totski\n",
      "on several occasions that such was the case, which the latter gentleman\n",
      "considered a very unpleasant communication indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, of late, Totski had observed many strange and original features\n",
      "and characteristics in Nastasia, which he had neither known nor\n",
      "reckoned upon in former times, and some of these fascinated him, even\n",
      "now, in spite of the fact that all his old calculations with regard to\n",
      "her were long ago cast to the winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "A maid opened the door for the prince (Nastasiaâs servants were all\n",
      "females) and, to his surprise, received his request to announce him to\n",
      "her mistress without any astonishment. Neither his dirty boots, nor his\n",
      "wide-brimmed hat, nor his sleeveless cloak, nor his evident confusion\n",
      "of manner, produced the least impression upon her. She helped him off\n",
      "with his cloak, and begged him to wait a moment in the ante-room while\n",
      "she announced him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company assembled at Nastasia Philipovnaâs consisted of none but\n",

      "with her usual gatherings on this anniversary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place there were present Totski, and General Epanchin.\n",
      "They were both highly amiable, but both appeared to be labouring under\n",
      "a half-hidden feeling of anxiety as to the result of Nastasiaâs\n",
      "deliberations with regard to Gania, which result was to be made public\n",
      "this evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, of course, there was Gania who was by no means so amiable as his\n",
      "elders, but stood apart, gloomy, and miserable, and silent. He had\n",
      "determined not to bring Varia with him; but Nastasia had not even asked\n",
      "after her, though no sooner had he arrived than she had reminded him of\n",
      "the episode between himself and the prince. The general, who had heard\n",
      "nothing of it before, began to listen with some interest, while Gania,\n",
      "drily, but with perfect candour, went through the whole history,\n",
      "including the fact of his apology to the prince. He finished by\n",
      "declaring that the prince was a most extraordinary man, and goodness\n",
      "knows why he had been considered an idiot hitherto, for he was very far\n",
      "from being one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia listened to all this with great interest; but the conversation\n",
      "soon turned to Rogojin and his visit, and this theme proved of the\n",
      "greatest attraction to both Totski and the general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ptitsin was able to afford some particulars as to Rogojinâs conduct\n",
      "since the afternoon. He declared that he had been busy finding money\n",
      "for the latter ever since, and up to nine oâclock, Rogojin having\n",
      "declared that he must absolutely have a hundred thousand roubles by the\n",
      "evening. He added that Rogojin was drunk, of course; but that he\n",
      "thought the money would be forthcoming, for the excited and intoxicated\n",
      "rapture of the fellow impelled him to give any interest or premium that\n",
      "was asked of him, and there were several others engaged in beating up\n",
      "the money, also.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this news was received by the company with somewhat gloomy\n",
      "interest. Nastasia was silent, and would not say what she thought about\n",
      "it. Gania was equally uncommunicative. The general seemed the most\n",
      "anxious of all, and decidedly uneasy. The present of pearls which he\n",
      "had prepared with so much joy in the morning had been accepted but\n",
      "coldly, and Nastasia had smiled rather disagreeably as she took it from\n",
      "him. Ferdishenko was the only person present in good spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totski himself, who had the reputation of being a capital talker, and\n",
      "was usually the life and soul of these entertainments, was as silent as\n",
      "any on this occasion, and sat in a state of, for him, most uncommon\n",
      "perturbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the guests (an old tutor or schoolmaster, goodness knows\n",
      "why invited; a young man, very timid, and shy and silent; a rather loud\n",
      "woman of about forty, apparently an actress; and a very pretty,\n",
      "well-dressed German lady who hardly said a word all the evening) not\n",
      "only had no gift for enlivening the proceedings, but hardly knew what\n",
      "to say for themselves when addressed. Under these circumstances the\n",
      "arrival of the prince came almost as a godsend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement of his name gave rise to some surprise and to some\n",
      "smiles, especially when it became evident, from Nastasiaâs astonished\n",
      "look, that she had not thought of inviting him. But her astonishment\n",
      "once over, Nastasia showed such satisfaction that all prepared to greet\n",
      "the prince with cordial smiles of welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course,â remarked General Epanchin, âhe does this out of pure\n",
      "innocence. Itâs a little dangerous, perhaps, to encourage this sort of\n",
      "freedom; but it is rather a good thing that he has arrived just at this\n",
      "moment. He may enliven us a little with his originalities.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âEspecially as he asked himself,â said Ferdishenko.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhatâs that got to do with it?â asked the general, who loathed\n",
      "Ferdishenko.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, he must pay toll for his entrance,â explained the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHâm! Prince Muishkin is not Ferdishenko,â said the general,\n",
      "impatiently. This worthy gentleman could never quite reconcile himself\n",
      "to the idea of meeting Ferdishenko in society, and on an equal footing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh general, spare Ferdishenko!â replied the other, smiling. âI have\n",
      "special privileges.â\n",

      "âWhat do you mean by special privileges?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOnce before I had the honour of stating them to the company. I will\n",
      "repeat the explanation to-day for your excellencyâs benefit. You see,\n",
      "excellency, all the world is witty and clever except myself. I am\n",
      "neither. As a kind of compensation I am allowed to tell the truth, for\n",
      "it is a well-known fact that only stupid people tell âthe truth.â Added\n",
      "to this, I am a spiteful man, just because I am not clever. If I am\n",
      "offended or injured I bear it quite patiently until the man injuring me\n",
      "meets with some misfortune. Then I remember, and take my revenge. I\n",
      "return the injury sevenfold, as Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin says. (Of\n",
      "course he never does so himself.) Excellency, no doubt you recollect\n",

      "That fable was written precisely for us.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou seem to be talking nonsense again, Ferdishenko,â growled the\n",
      "general.\n",

      "âWhat is the matter, excellency? I know how to keep my place. When I\n",
      "said just now that we, you and I, were the lion and the ass of\n",
      "Kryloffâs fable, of course it is understood that I take the role of the\n",

      "\n",
      "âA mighty lion, terror of the woods,\n",

      "\n",
      "âI am of your opinion on that last point,â said Ivan Fedorovitch, with\n",
      "ill-concealed irritation.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was no doubt extremely coarse, and moreover it was\n",
      "premeditated, but after all Ferdishenko had persuaded everyone to\n",
      "accept him as a buffoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf I am admitted and tolerated here,â he had said one day, âit is\n",
      "simply because I talk in this way. How can anyone possibly receive such\n",
      "a man as I am? I quite understand. Now, could I, a Ferdishenko, be\n",
      "allowed to sit shoulder to shoulder with a clever man like Afanasy\n",
      "Ivanovitch? There is one explanation, only one. I am given the position\n",
      "because it is so entirely inconceivable!â\n",
      "\n",
      "But these vulgarities seemed to please Nastasia Philipovna, although\n",
      "too often they were both rude and offensive. Those who wished to go to\n",
      "her house were forced to put up with Ferdishenko. Possibly the latter\n",
      "was not mistaken in imagining that he was received simply in order to\n",
      "annoy Totski, who disliked him extremely. Gania also was often made the\n",
      "butt of the jesterâs sarcasms, who used this method of keeping in\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovnaâs good graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe prince will begin by singing us a fashionable ditty,â remarked\n",

      "would say.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât think so, Ferdishenko; please be quiet,â answered Nastasia\n",

      "So saying she gazed into his eyes, longing to see whether she could\n",
      "make any guess as to the explanation of his motive in coming to her\n",
      "house. The prince would very likely have made some reply to her kind\n",
      "words, but he was so dazzled by her appearance that he could not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia noticed this with satisfaction. She was in full dress this\n",
      "evening; and her appearance was certainly calculated to impress all\n",
      "beholders. She took his hand and led him towards her other guests. But\n",
      "just before they reached the drawing-room door, the prince stopped her,\n",
      "and hurriedly and in great agitation whispered to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are altogether perfection; even your pallor and thinness are\n",
      "perfect; one could not wish you otherwise. I did so wish to come and\n",
      "see you. Iâforgive me, pleaseââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âDonât apologize,â said Nastasia, laughing; âyou spoil the whole\n",
      "originality of the thing. I think what they say about you must be true,\n",
      "that you are so original.âSo you think me perfection, do you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHâm! Well, you may be a good reader of riddles but you are wrong\n",

      "\n",
      "Nastasia introduced the prince to her guests, to most of whom he was\n",
      "already known.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totski immediately made some amiable remark. All seemed to brighten up\n",
      "at once, and the conversation became general. Nastasia made the prince\n",
      "sit down next to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDear me, thereâs nothing so very curious about the prince dropping in,\n",
      "after all,â remarked Ferdishenko.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs quite a clear case,â said the hitherto silent Gania. âI have\n",
      "watched the prince almost all day, ever since the moment when he first\n",
      "saw Nastasia Philipovnaâs portrait, at General Epanchinâs. I remember\n",
      "thinking at the time what I am now pretty sure of; and what, I may say\n",
      "in passing, the prince confessed to myself.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania said all this perfectly seriously, and without the slightest\n",

      "something that he really and honestly considered the very worst action\n",
      "he had ever committed in his life. But he was to be honestâthat was the\n",

      "must draw lots! Throw your slips of paper, gentlemen, into this hat,\n",

      "eyes were blazing, and her cheeks showed two bright red spots against\n",
      "the white. The melancholy appearance of some of her guests seemed to\n",
      "add to her sarcastic humour, and perhaps the very cynicism and cruelty\n",
      "of the game proposed by Ferdishenko pleased her. At all events she was\n",
      "attracted by the idea, and gradually her guests came round to her side;\n",

      "\n",
      "âPerhaps so; but it is hardly possible that you told it so that it\n",

      "ladies and gentlemenâis yours in, Mr. Totski? Soâthen we are all ready;\n",
      "now prince, draw, please.â The prince silently put his hand into the\n",
      "hat, and drew the names. Ferdishenko was first, then Ptitsin, then the\n",
      "general, Totski next, his own fifth, then Gania, and so on; the ladies\n",
      "did not draw.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, dear! oh, dear!â cried Ferdishenko. âI did so hope the prince\n",

      "I must set a good example! What vexes me much is that I am such an\n",

      "He had a dinner party. After dinner the men stayed at the table over\n",
      "their wine. It struck me to ask the daughter of the house to play\n",
      "something on the piano; so I passed through the corner room to join the\n",
      "ladies. In that room, on Maria Ivanovnaâs writing-table, I observed a\n",
      "three-rouble note. She must have taken it out for some purpose, and\n",
      "left it lying there. There was no one about. I took up the note and put\n",
      "it in my pocket; why, I canât say. I donât know what possessed me to do\n",
      "it, but it was done, and I went quickly back to the dining-room and\n",
      "reseated myself at the dinner-table. I sat and waited there in a great\n",

      "\n",

      "Daria quite lost her head, and that I began assuring her, before\n",
      "everyone, that I would guarantee her forgiveness on the part of her\n",
      "mistress, if she would confess her guilt. They all stared at the girl,\n",
      "and I remember a wonderful attraction in the reflection that here was I\n",
      "sermonizing away, with the money in my own pocket all the while. I went\n",
      "and spent the three roubles that very evening at a restaurant. I went\n",
      "in and asked for a bottle of Lafite, and drank it up; I wanted to be\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âHow mean you were!â said Nastasia.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBah! you wish to hear a man tell of his worst actions, and you expect\n",
      "the story to come out goody-goody! Oneâs worst actions always are mean.\n",
      "We shall see what the general has to say for himself now. All is not\n",
      "gold that glitters, you know; and because a man keeps his carriage he\n",
      "need not be specially virtuous, I assure you, all sorts of people keep\n",
      "carriages. And by what means?â\n",
      "\n",
      "In a word, Ferdishenko was very angry and rapidly forgetting himself;\n",
      "his whole face was drawn with passion. Strange as it may appear, he had\n",
      "expected much better success for his story. These little errors of\n",
      "taste on Ferdishenkoâs part occurred very frequently. Nastasia trembled\n",
      "with rage, and looked fixedly at him, whereupon he relapsed into\n",
      "alarmed silence. He realized that he had gone a little too far.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHad we not better end this game?â asked Totski.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs my turn, but I plead exemption,â said Ptitsin.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou donât care to oblige us?â asked Nastasia.\n",

      "\n",
      "âThen, general, itâs your turn,â continued Nastasia Philipovna, âand if\n",
      "you refuse, the whole game will fall through, which will disappoint me\n",
      "very much, for I was looking forward to relating a certain âpage of my\n",

      "prepared a little story in anticipation of my turn.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia smiled amiably at him; but evidently her depression and\n",

      "\n",
      "âI, like everyone else,â began the general, âhave committed certain not\n",
      "altogether graceful actions, so to speak, during the course of my life.\n",
      "But the strangest thing of all in my case is, that I should consider\n",
      "the little anecdote which I am now about to give you as a confession of\n",
      "the worst of my âbad actions.â It is thirty-five years since it all\n",

      "ensignsâtheir blood is boiling water, their circumstances generally\n",
      "penurious. Well, I had a servant Nikifor who used to do everything for\n",
      "me in my quarters, economized and managed for me, and even laid hands\n",
      "on anything he could find (belonging to other people), in order to\n",
      "augment our household goods; but a faithful, honest fellow all the\n",
      "same.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI was strict, but just by nature. At that time we were stationed in a\n",

      "widow of eighty years of age. She lived in a wretched little wooden\n",

      "\n",

      "fowl of mine; the business is a mystery to this day; but it could have\n",
      "been no one but herself. I requested to be quartered somewhere else,\n",
      "and was shifted to the other end of the town, to the house of a\n",
      "merchant with a large family, and a long beard, as I remember him.\n",
      "Nikifor and I were delighted to go; but the old lady was not pleased at\n",
      "our departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, a day or two afterwards, when I returned from drill, Nikifor\n",
      "says to me: âWe oughtnât to have left our tureen with the old lady,\n",
      "Iâve nothing to serve the soup in.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI asked how it came about that the tureen had been left. Nikifor\n",
      "explained that the old lady refused to give it up, because, she said,\n",
      "we had broken her bowl, and she must have our tureen in place of it;\n",
      "she had declared that I had so arranged the matter with herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis baseness on her part of course aroused my young blood to fever\n",

      "\n",
      "âI arrived at the old womanâs house beside myself. She was sitting in a\n",
      "corner all alone, leaning her face on her hand. I fell on her like a\n",
      "clap of thunder. âYou old wretch!â I yelled and all that sort of thing,\n",
      "in real Russian style. Well, when I began cursing at her, a strange\n",
      "thing happened. I looked at her, and she stared back with her eyes\n",
      "starting out of her head, but she did not say a word. She seemed to\n",
      "sway about as she sat, and looked and looked at me in the strangest\n",
      "way. Well, I soon stopped swearing and looked closer at her, asked her\n",
      "questions, but not a word could I get out of her. The flies were\n",
      "buzzing about the room and only this sound broke the silence; the sun\n",
      "was setting outside; I didnât know what to make of it, so I went away.\n",

      "told of the former. He possessed, it was said, a set of false teeth,\n",
      "and one day when he wanted money for a drinking orgy, he pawned them,\n",
      "and was never able to reclaim them! The officer appeared to be a rival\n",
      "of the gentleman who was so proud of his fists. He was known to none of\n",
      "Rogojinâs followers, but as they passed by the Nevsky, where he stood\n",
      "begging, he had joined their ranks. His claim for the charity he\n",
      "desired seemed based on the fact that in the days of his prosperity he\n",
      "had given away as much as fifteen roubles at a time. The rivals seemed\n",
      "more than a little jealous of one another. The athlete appeared injured\n",
      "at the admission of the âbeggarâ into the company. By nature taciturn,\n",
      "he now merely growled occasionally like a bear, and glared\n",
      "contemptuously upon the âbeggar,â who, being somewhat of a man of the\n",
      "world, and a diplomatist, tried to insinuate himself into the bearâs\n",
      "good graces. He was a much smaller man than the athlete, and doubtless\n",
      "was conscious that he must tread warily. Gently and without argument he\n",
      "alluded to the advantages of the English style in boxing, and showed\n",
      "himself a firm believer in Western institutions. The athleteâs lips\n",
      "curled disdainfully, and without honouring his adversary with a formal\n",
      "denial, he exhibited, as if by accident, that peculiarly Russian\n",
      "objectâan enormous fist, clenched, muscular, and covered with red\n",
      "hairs! The sight of this pre-eminently national attribute was enough to\n",
      "convince anybody, without words, that it was a serious matter for those\n",
      "who should happen to come into contact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the band were very drunk, for the leader had kept his intended\n",
      "visit to Nastasia in view all day, and had done his best to prevent his\n",
      "followers from drinking too much. He was sober himself, but the\n",
      "excitement of this chaotic dayâthe strangest day of his lifeâhad\n",
      "affected him so that he was in a dazed, wild condition, which almost\n",
      "resembled drunkenness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had kept but one idea before him all day, and for that he had worked\n",
      "in an agony of anxiety and a fever of suspense. His lieutenants had\n",
      "worked so hard from five oâclock until eleven, that they actually had\n",
      "collected a hundred thousand roubles for him, but at such terrific\n",
      "expense, that the rate of interest was only mentioned among them in\n",
      "whispers and with bated breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, Rogojin walked in advance of his troop, who followed him\n",
      "with mingled self-assertion and timidity. They were specially\n",
      "frightened of Nastasia Philipovna herself, for some reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of them expected to be thrown downstairs at once, without further\n",
      "ceremony, the elegant and irresistible Zaleshoff among them. But the\n",
      "party led by the athlete, without openly showing their hostile\n",
      "intentions, silently nursed contempt and even hatred for Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna, and marched into her house as they would have marched into\n",
      "an enemyâs fortress. Arrived there, the luxury of the rooms seemed to\n",
      "inspire them with a kind of respect, not unmixed with alarm. So many\n",
      "things were entirely new to their experienceâthe choice furniture, the\n",
      "pictures, the great statue of Venus. They followed their chief into the\n",
      "salon, however, with a kind of impudent curiosity. There, the sight of\n",
      "General Epanchin among the guests, caused many of them to beat a hasty\n",
      "retreat into the adjoining room, the âboxerâ and âbeggarâ being among\n",
      "the first to go. A few only, of whom Lebedeff made one, stood their\n",
      "ground; he had contrived to walk side by side with Rogojin, for he\n",
      "quite understood the importance of a man who had a fortune of a million\n",
      "odd roubles, and who at this moment carried a hundred thousand in his\n",
      "hand. It may be added that the whole company, not excepting Lebedeff,\n",
      "had the vaguest idea of the extent of their powers, and of how far they\n",
      "could safely go. At some moments Lebedeff was sure that right was on\n",
      "their side; at others he tried uneasily to remember various cheering\n",
      "and reassuring articles of the Civil Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin, when he stepped into the room, and his eyes fell upon\n",
      "Nastasia, stopped short, grew white as a sheet, and stood staring; it\n",
      "was clear that his heart was beating painfully. So he stood, gazing\n",
      "intently, but timidly, for a few seconds. Suddenly, as though bereft of\n",
      "his senses, he moved forward, staggering helplessly, towards the table.\n",
      "On his way he collided against Ptitsinâs chair, and put his dirty foot\n",
      "on the lace skirt of the silent ladyâs dress; but he neither apologized\n",
      "for this, nor even noticed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the table, he placed upon it a strange-looking object,\n",
      "which he had carried with him into the drawing-room. This was a paper\n",
      "packet, some six or seven inches thick, and eight or nine in length,\n",
      "wrapped in an old newspaper, and tied round three or four times with\n",
      "string.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having placed this before her, he stood with drooped arms and head, as\n",
      "though awaiting his sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "His costume was the same as it had been in the morning, except for a\n",
      "new silk handkerchief round his neck, bright green and red, fastened\n",
      "with a huge diamond pin, and an enormous diamond ring on his dirty\n",
      "forefinger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff stood two or three paces behind his chief; and the rest of the\n",
      "band waited about near the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two maid-servants were both peeping in, frightened and amazed at\n",
      "this unusual and disorderly scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat is that?â asked Nastasia Philipovna, gazing intently at Rogojin,\n",
      "and indicating the paper packet.\n",
      "\n",
      "âA hundred thousand,â replied the latter, almost in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh! so he kept his wordâthereâs a man for you! Well, sit down,\n",
      "pleaseâtake that chair. I shall have something to say to you presently.\n",
      "Who are all these with you? The same party? Let them come in and sit\n",
      "down. Thereâs room on that sofa, there are some chairs and thereâs\n",
      "another sofa! Well, why donât they sit down?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure enough, some of the brave fellows entirely lost their heads at\n",
      "this point, and retreated into the next room. Others, however, took the\n",
      "hint and sat down, as far as they could from the table, however;\n",
      "feeling braver in proportion to their distance from Nastasia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin took the chair offered him, but he did not sit long; he soon\n",
      "stood up again, and did not reseat himself. Little by little he began\n",
      "to look around him and discern the other guests. Seeing Gania, he\n",
      "smiled venomously and muttered to himself, âLook at that!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He gazed at Totski and the general with no apparent confusion, and with\n",
      "very little curiosity. But when he observed that the prince was seated\n",
      "beside Nastasia Philipovna, he could not take his eyes off him for a\n",
      "long while, and was clearly amazed. He could not account for the\n",
      "princeâs presence there. It was not in the least surprising that\n",
      "Rogojin should be, at this time, in a more or less delirious condition;\n",
      "for not to speak of the excitements of the day, he had spent the night\n",
      "before in the train, and had not slept more than a wink for forty-eight\n",
      "hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis, gentlemen, is a hundred thousand roubles,â said Nastasia\n",

      "parcel. This afternoon Rogojin yelled, like a madman, that he would\n",
      "bring me a hundred thousand in the evening, and I have been waiting for\n",
      "him all the while. He was bargaining for me, you know; first he offered\n",
      "me eighteen thousand; then he rose to forty, and then to a hundred\n",
      "thousand. And he has kept his word, see! My goodness, how white he is!\n",
      "All this happened this afternoon, at Ganiaâs. I had gone to pay his\n",
      "mother a visitâmy future family, you know! And his sister said to my\n",

      "he bargained with me! Yet you could come here and expect to be\n",
      "betrothed to me before you left the house! You almost brought your\n",

      "bequeathing her newly-acquired fortune to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared that neither the prince, nor the doctor with whom he lived\n",
      "in Switzerland, had thought of waiting for further communications; but\n",
      "the prince had started straight away with Salaskinâs letter in his\n",
      "pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOne thing I may tell you, for certain,â concluded Ptitsin, addressing\n",
      "the prince, âthat there is no question about the authenticity of this\n",

      "unquestionable right to this inheritance, you may look upon as so much\n",
      "money in your pocket. I congratulate you, prince; you may receive a\n",
      "million and a half of roubles, perhaps more; I donât know. All I _do_\n",
      "know is that Paparchin was a very rich merchant indeed.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHurrah!â cried Lebedeff, in a drunken voice. âHurrah for the last of\n",
      "the Muishkins!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMy goodness me! and I gave him twenty-five roubles this morning as\n",
      "though he were a beggar,â blurted out the general, half senseless with\n",
      "amazement. âWell, I congratulate you, I congratulate you!â And the\n",
      "general rose from his seat and solemnly embraced the prince. All came\n",
      "forward with congratulations; even those of Rogojinâs party who had\n",
      "retreated into the next room, now crept softly back to look on. For the\n",
      "moment even Nastasia Philipovna was forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "But gradually the consciousness crept back into the minds of each one\n",
      "present that the prince had just made her an offer of marriage. The\n",
      "situation had, therefore, become three times as fantastic as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totski sat and shrugged his shoulders, bewildered. He was the only\n",
      "guest left sitting at this time; the others had thronged round the\n",
      "table in disorder, and were all talking at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was generally agreed, afterwards, in recalling that evening, that\n",
      "from this moment Nastasia Philipovna seemed entirely to lose her\n",
      "senses. She continued to sit still in her place, looking around at her\n",
      "guests with a strange, bewildered expression, as though she were trying\n",
      "to collect her thoughts, and could not. Then she suddenly turned to the\n",
      "prince, and glared at him with frowning brows; but this only lasted one\n",
      "moment. Perhaps it suddenly struck her that all this was a jest, but\n",
      "his face seemed to reassure her. She reflected, and smiled again,\n",
      "vaguely.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo I am really a princess,â she whispered to herself, ironically, and\n",
      "glancing accidentally at Daria Alexeyevnaâs face, she burst out\n",
      "laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHa, ha, ha!â she cried, âthis is an unexpected climax, after all. I\n",

      "down; congratulate me and the prince! Ferdishenko, just step out and\n",
      "order some more champagne, will you? Katia, Pasha,â she added suddenly,\n",
      "seeing the servants at the door, âcome here! Iâm going to be married,\n",
      "did you hear? To the prince. He has a million and a half of roubles; he\n",
      "is Prince Muishkin, and has asked me to marry him. Here, prince, come\n",
      "and sit by me; and here comes the wine. Now then, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
      "where are your congratulations?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHurrah!â cried a number of voices. A rush was made for the wine by\n",
      "Rogojinâs followers, though, even among them, there seemed some sort of\n",
      "realization that the situation had changed. Rogojin stood and looked\n",
      "on, with an incredulous smile, screwing up one side of his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPrince, my dear fellow, do remember what you are about,â said the\n",

      "\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna overheard the remark, and burst out laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, no, general!â she cried. âYou had better look out! I am the\n",
      "princess now, you know. The prince wonât let you insult me. Afanasy\n",
      "Ivanovitch, why donât you congratulate me? I shall be able to sit at\n",
      "table with your new wife, now. Aha! you see what I gain by marrying a\n",
      "prince! A million and a half, and a prince, and an idiot into the\n",
      "bargain, they say. What better could I wish for? Life is only just\n",
      "about to commence for me in earnest. Rogojin, you are a little too\n",
      "late. Away with your paper parcel! Iâm going to marry the prince; Iâm\n",
      "richer than you are now.â\n",
      "\n",
      "But Rogojin understood how things were tending, at last. An\n",
      "inexpressibly painful expression came over his face. He wrung his\n",
      "hands; a groan made its way up from the depths of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSurrender her, for Godâs sake!â he said to the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "All around burst out laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat? Surrender her to _you?_â cried Daria Alexeyevna. âTo a fellow\n",
      "who comes and bargains for a wife like a moujik! The prince wishes to\n",
      "marry her, and youââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo do I, so do I! This moment, if I could! Iâd give every farthing I\n",
      "have to do it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou drunken moujik,â said Daria Alexeyevna, once more. âYou ought to\n",
      "be kicked out of the place.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The laughter became louder than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you hear, prince?â said Nastasia Philipovna. âDo you hear how this\n",

      "\n",
      "âHe is drunk,â said the prince, quietly, âand he loves you very much.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWonât you be ashamed, afterwards, to reflect that your wife very\n",
      "nearly ran away with Rogojin?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, you were raving, you were in a fever; you are still half\n",
      "delirious.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd wonât you be ashamed when they tell you, afterwards, that your\n",
      "wife lived at Totskiâs expense so many years?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo; I shall not be ashamed of that. You did not so live by your own\n",

      "\n",
      "âNastasia Philipovna.â said the prince, quietly, and with deep emotion,\n",
      "âI said before that I shall esteem your consent to be my wife as a\n",
      "great honour to myself, and shall consider that it is you who will\n",
      "honour me, not I you, by our marriage. You laughed at these words, and\n",
      "others around us laughed as well; I heard them. Very likely I expressed\n",
      "myself funnily, and I may have looked funny, but, for all that, I\n",
      "believe I understand where honour lies, and what I said was but the\n",
      "literal truth. You were about to ruin yourself just now, irrevocably;\n",
      "you would never have forgiven yourself for so doing afterwards; and\n",
      "yet, you are absolutely blameless. It is impossible that your life\n",
      "should be altogether ruined at your age. What matter that Rogojin came\n",
      "bargaining here, and that Gavrila Ardalionovitch would have deceived\n",
      "you if he could? Why do you continually remind us of these facts? I\n",
      "assure you once more that very few could find it in them to act as you\n",
      "have acted this day. As for your wish to go with Rogojin, that was\n",
      "simply the idea of a delirious and suffering brain. You are still quite\n",
      "feverish; you ought to be in bed, not here. You know quite well that if\n",
      "you had gone with Rogojin, you would have become a washer-woman next\n",
      "day, rather than stay with him. You are proud, Nastasia Philipovna, and\n",
      "perhaps you have really suffered so much that you imagine yourself to\n",
      "be a desperately guilty woman. You require a great deal of petting and\n",
      "looking after, Nastasia Philipovna, and I will do this. I saw your\n",
      "portrait this morning, and it seemed quite a familiar face to me; it\n",
      "seemed to me that the portrait-face was calling to me for help. IâI\n",
      "shall respect you all my life, Nastasia Philipovna,â concluded the\n",
      "prince, as though suddenly recollecting himself, and blushing to think\n",
      "of the sort of company before whom he had said all this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ptitsin bowed his head and looked at the ground, overcome by a mixture\n",
      "of feelings. Totski muttered to himself: âHe may be an idiot, but he\n",
      "knows that flattery is the best road to success here.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince observed Ganiaâs eyes flashing at him, as though they would\n",

      "\n",
      "âThatâs a kind-hearted man, if you like,â said Daria Alexeyevna, whose\n",

      "\n",
      "âA refined man, butâlost,â murmured the general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totski took his hat and rose to go. He and the general exchanged\n",

      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThank you, prince; no one has ever spoken to me like that before,â\n",
      "began Nastasia Philipovna. âMen have always bargained for me, before\n",
      "this; and not a single respectable man has ever proposed to marry me.\n",
      "Do you hear, Afanasy Ivanovitch? What do _you_ think of what the prince\n",
      "has just been saying? It was almost immodest, wasnât it? You, Rogojin,\n",
      "wait a moment, donât go yet! I see you donât intend to move however.\n",
      "Perhaps I may go with you yet. Where did you mean to take me to?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âTo Ekaterinhof,â replied Lebedeff. Rogojin simply stood staring, with\n",
      "trembling lips, not daring to believe his ears. He was stunned, as\n",
      "though from a blow on the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat are you thinking of, my dear Nastasia?â said Daria Alexeyevna in\n",

      "\n",

      "did you?â she cried. âThatâs Totskiâs way, not mine. Heâs fond of\n",
      "children. Come along, Rogojin, get your money ready! We wonât talk\n",
      "about marrying just at this moment, but letâs see the money at all\n",
      "events. Come! I may not marry you, either. I donât know. I suppose you\n",
      "thought youâd keep the money, if I did! Ha, ha, ha! nonsense! I have no\n",
      "sense of shame left. I tell you I have been Totskiâs concubine. Prince,\n",
      "you must marry Aglaya Ivanovna, not Nastasia Philipovna, or this fellow\n",
      "Ferdishenko will always be pointing the finger of scorn at you. You\n",
      "arenât afraid, I know; but I should always be afraid that I had ruined\n",
      "you, and that you would reproach me for it. As for what you say about\n",
      "my doing you honour by marrying youâwell, Totski can tell you all about\n",
      "that. You had your eye on Aglaya, Gania, you know you had; and you\n",
      "might have married her if you had not come bargaining. You are all like\n",
      "this. You should choose, once for all, between disreputable women, and\n",
      "respectable ones, or you are sure to get mixed. Look at the general,\n",
      "how heâs staring at me!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis is too horrible,â said the general, starting to his feet. All\n",
      "were standing up now. Nastasia was absolutely beside herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am very proud, in spite of what I am,â she continued. âYou called me\n",
      "âperfectionâ just now, prince. A nice sort of perfection to throw up a\n",
      "prince and a million and a half of roubles in order to be able to boast\n",
      "of the fact afterwards! What sort of a wife should I make for you,\n",
      "after all I have said? Afanasy Ivanovitch, do you observe I have really\n",
      "and truly thrown away a million of roubles? And you thought that I\n",
      "should consider your wretched seventy-five thousand, with Gania thrown\n",
      "in for a husband, a paradise of bliss! Take your seventy-five thousand\n",
      "back, sir; you did not reach the hundred thousand. Rogojin cut a better\n",
      "dash than you did. Iâll console Gania myself; I have an idea about\n",
      "that. But now I must be off! Iâve been in prison for ten years. Iâm\n",
      "free at last! Well, Rogojin, what are you waiting for? Letâs get ready\n",
      "and go.â\n",
      "\n",

      "mine, everythingâs mine! Sheâs a queen, get away!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He was panting with ecstasy. He walked round and round Nastasia\n",

      "\n",
      "All the Rogojin company were now collected in the drawing-room; some\n",
      "were drinking, some laughed and talked: all were in the highest and\n",
      "wildest spirits. Ferdishenko was doing his best to unite himself to\n",
      "them; the general and Totski again made an attempt to go. Gania, too\n",
      "stood hat in hand ready to go; but seemed to be unable to tear his eyes\n",
      "away from the scene before him.\n",

      "there it all is on the table. Here, give me over that packet! Is there\n",
      "a hundred thousand roubles in that one packet? Pfu! what abominable\n",
      "stuff it looks! Oh! nonsense, Daria Alexeyevna; you surely did not\n",
      "expect me to ruin _him?_â (indicating the prince). âFancy him nursing\n",
      "me! Why, he needs a nurse himself! The general, there, will be his\n",
      "nurse now, youâll see. Here, prince, look here! Your bride is accepting\n",
      "money. What a disreputable woman she must be! And you wished to marry\n",
      "her! What are you crying about? Is it a bitter dose? Never mind, you\n",
      "shall laugh yet. Trust to time.â (In spite of these words there were\n",
      "two large tears rolling down Nastasiaâs own cheeks.) âItâs far better\n",
      "to think twice of it now than afterwards. Oh! you mustnât cry like\n",
      "that! Thereâs Katia crying, too. What is it, Katia, dear? I shall leave\n",
      "you and Pasha a lot of things, Iâve laid them out for you already; but\n",
      "good-bye, now. I made an honest girl like you serve a low woman like\n",
      "myself. Itâs better so, prince, it is indeed. Youâd begin to despise me\n",
      "afterwardsâwe should never be happy. Oh! you neednât swear, prince, I\n",
      "shanât believe you, you know. How foolish it would be, too! No, no;\n",
      "weâd better say good-bye and part friends. I am a bit of a dreamer\n",

      "should come and say to me: âYou are an innocent woman, Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna, and I adore you.â I dreamt of you often. I used to think so\n",
      "much down there that I nearly went mad; and then this fellow here would\n",
      "come down. He would stay a couple of months out of the twelve, and\n",
      "disgrace and insult and deprave me, and then go; so that I longed to\n",
      "drown myself in the pond a thousand times over; but I did not dare do\n",
      "it. I hadnât the heart, and nowâwell, are you ready, Rogojin?â\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, but, positively, you knowâa hundred thousand roubles!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âGoodness gracious! good heavens!â came from all quarters of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "All now crowded round the fire and thronged to see what was going on;\n",
      "everyone lamented and gave vent to exclamations of horror and woe. Some\n",
      "jumped up on chairs in order to get a better view. Daria Alexeyevna ran\n",
      "into the next room and whispered excitedly to Katia and Pasha. The\n",
      "beautiful German disappeared altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMy lady! my sovereign!â lamented Lebedeff, falling on his knees before\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna, and stretching out his hands towards the fire;\n",
      "âitâs a hundred thousand roubles, it is indeed, I packed it up myself,\n",
      "I saw the money! My queen, let me get into the fire after itâsay the\n",
      "wordâIâll put my whole grey head into the fire for it! I have a poor\n",
      "lame wife and thirteen children. My father died of starvation last\n",
      "week. Nastasia Philipovna, Nastasia Philipovna!â The wretched little\n",
      "man wept, and groaned, and crawled towards the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAway, out of the way!â cried Nastasia. âMake room, all of you! Gania,\n",
      "what are you standing there for? Donât stand on ceremony. Put in your\n",
      "hand! Thereâs your whole happiness smouldering away, look! Quick!â\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gania had borne too much that day, and especially this evening, and\n",
      "he was not prepared for this last, quite unexpected trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd parted on each side of him and he was left face to face with\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna, three paces from her. She stood by the fire and\n",
      "waited, with her intent gaze fixed upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania stood before her, in his evening clothes, holding his white\n",
      "gloves and hat in his hand, speechless and motionless, with arms folded\n",
      "and eyes fixed on the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "A silly, meaningless smile played on his white, death-like lips. He\n",
      "could not take his eyes off the smouldering packet; but it appeared\n",
      "that something new had come to birth in his soulâas though he were\n",
      "vowing to himself that he would bear this trial. He did not move from\n",
      "his place. In a few seconds it became evident to all that he did not\n",
      "intend to rescue the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHey! look at it, itâll burn in another minute or two!â cried Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna. âYouâll hang yourself afterwards, you know, if it does! Iâm\n",
      "not joking.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire, choked between a couple of smouldering pieces of wood, had\n",
      "died down for the first few moments after the packet was thrown upon\n",
      "it. But a little tongue of fire now began to lick the paper from below,\n",
      "and soon, gathering courage, mounted the sides of the parcel, and crept\n",
      "around it. In another moment, the whole of it burst into flames, and\n",
      "the exclamations of woe and horror were redoubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNastasia Philipovna!â lamented Lebedeff again, straining towards the\n",
      "fireplace; but Rogojin dragged him away, and pushed him to the rear\n",
      "once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole of Rogojinâs being was concentrated in one rapturous gaze of\n",
      "ecstasy. He could not take his eyes off Nastasia. He stood drinking her\n",
      "in, as it were. He was in the seventh heaven of delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, what a queen she is!â he ejaculated, every other minute, throwing\n",
      "out the remark for anyone who liked to catch it. âThatâs the sort of\n",
      "woman for me! Which of you would think of doing a thing like that, you\n",
      "blackguards, eh?â he yelled. He was hopelessly and wildly beside\n",
      "himself with ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince watched the whole scene, silent and dejected.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âSo would I,â said another, from behind, âwith pleasure. Devil take the\n",

      "\n",
      "âItâs burning, itâs burning!â cried all, thronging nearer and nearer to\n",

      "\n",
      "âGet on, quick!â shrieked Ferdishenko, rushing wildly up to Gania, and\n",
      "trying to drag him to the fire by the sleeve of his coat. âGet it, you\n",
      "dummy, itâs burning away fast! Ohâ_damn_ the thing!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Gania hurled Ferdishenko from him; then he turned sharp round and made\n",

      "and fell to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHeâs fainted!â the cry went round.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd the moneyâs burning still,â Lebedeff lamented.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBurning for nothing,â shouted others.\n",
      "\n",
      "âKatia-Pasha! Bring him some water!â cried Nastasia Philipovna. Then\n",
      "she took the tongs and fished out the packet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly the whole of the outer covering was burned away, but it was soon\n",
      "evident that the contents were hardly touched. The packet had been\n",
      "wrapped in a threefold covering of newspaper, and the notes were safe.\n",
      "All breathed more freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSome dirty little thousand or so may be touched,â said Lebedeff,\n",

      "\n",
      "âItâs all hisâthe whole packet is for him, do you hearâall of you?â\n",
      "cried Nastasia Philipovna, placing the packet by the side of Gania. âHe\n",
      "restrained himself, and didnât go after it; so his self-respect is\n",
      "greater than his thirst for money. All rightâheâll come to directlyâhe\n",
      "must have the packet or heâll cut his throat afterwards. There! Heâs\n",
      "coming to himself. General, Totski, all of you, did you hear me? The\n",
      "money is all Ganiaâs. I give it to him, fully conscious of my action,\n",
      "as recompense forâwell, for anything he thinks best. Tell him so. Let\n",
      "it lie here beside him. Off we go, Rogojin! Goodbye, prince. I have\n",

      "\n",
      "The Rogojin gang followed their leader and Nastasia Philipovna to the\n",

      "\n",
      "In the hall the servants were waiting, and handed her her fur cloak.\n",

      "\n",
      "âAre you really throwing us all over, little mother? Where, where are\n",

      "The prince hurried down to the front gate where the party were settling\n",

      "\n",
      "âPrince, prince!â he cried, seizing hold of his arm, ârecollect\n",

      "\n",
      "The general was just in time to see the prince take the first sledge he\n",
      "could get, and, giving the order to Ekaterinhof, start off in pursuit\n",
      "of the troikas. Then the generalâs fine grey horse dragged that worthy\n",
      "home, with some new thoughts, and some new hopes and calculations\n",
      "developing in his brain, and with the pearls in his pocket, for he had\n",
      "not forgotten to bring them along with him, being a man of business.\n",
      "Amid his new thoughts and ideas there came, once or twice, the image of\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna. The general sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm sorry, really sorry,â he muttered. âSheâs a ruined woman. Mad!\n",

      "\n",
      "âDo you know, Totski, this is all very like what they say goes on among\n",
      "the Japanese?â said Ptitsin. âThe offended party there, they say,\n",
      "marches off to his insulter and says to him, âYou insulted me, so I\n",
      "have come to rip myself open before your eyes;â and with these words he\n",
      "does actually rip his stomach open before his enemy, and considers,\n",
      "doubtless, that he is having all possible and necessary satisfaction\n",
      "and revenge. There are strange characters in the world, sir!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHâm! and you think there was something of this sort here, do you? Dear\n",
      "meâa very remarkable comparison, you know! But you must have observed,\n",
      "my dear Ptitsin, that I did all I possibly could. I could do no more\n",
      "than I did. And you must admit that there are some rare qualities in\n",
      "this woman. I felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have\n",
      "been tempted to cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was\n",
      "my best justification. Such a woman could make anyone forget all\n",
      "reasonâeverything! Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her a\n",
      "hundred thousand roubles! Of course, all that happened tonight was\n",
      "ephemeral, fantastic, unseemlyâyet it lacked neither colour nor\n",
      "originality. My God! What might not have been made of such a character\n",
      "combined with such beauty! Yet in spite of all effortsâin spite of all\n",

      "I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovnaâs birthday\n",
      "party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this\n",
      "story, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in\n",
      "order to see after some business connected with the receipt of his\n",
      "unexpected fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure;\n",
      "but as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his\n",
      "prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little\n",
      "information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most\n",
      "interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about\n",
      "him all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but\n",
      "these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course the Epanchin family was much interested in his movements,\n",
      "though he had not had time to bid them farewell before his departure.\n",
      "The general, however, had had an opportunity of seeing him once or\n",
      "twice since the eventful evening, and had spoken very seriously with\n",
      "him; but though he had seen the prince, as I say, he told his family\n",
      "nothing about the circumstance. In fact, for a month or so after his\n",
      "departure it was considered not the thing to mention the princeâs name\n",
      "in the Epanchin household. Only Mrs. Epanchin, at the commencement of\n",
      "this period, had announced that she had been âcruelly mistaken in the\n",
      "prince!â and a day or two after, she had added, evidently alluding to\n",
      "him, but not mentioning his name, that it was an unalterable\n",
      "characteristic of hers to be mistaken in people. Then once more, ten\n",
      "days later, after some passage of arms with one of her daughters, she\n",
      "had remarked sententiously. âWe have had enough of mistakes. I shall be\n",
      "more careful in future!â However, it was impossible to avoid remarking\n",
      "that there was some sense of oppression in the householdâsomething\n",
      "unspoken, but felt; something strained. All the members of the family\n",
      "wore frowning looks. The general was unusually busy; his family hardly\n",
      "ever saw him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the girls, nothing was said openly, at all events; and probably\n",
      "very little in private. They were proud damsels, and were not always\n",
      "perfectly confidential even among themselves. But they understood each\n",
      "other thoroughly at the first word on all occasions; very often at the\n",
      "first glance, so that there was no need of much talking as a rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "One fact, at least, would have been perfectly plain to an outsider, had\n",
      "any such person been on the spot; and that was, that the prince had\n",
      "made a very considerable impression upon the family, in spite of the\n",
      "fact that he had but once been inside the house, and then only for a\n",
      "short time. Of course, if analyzed, this impression might have proved\n",
      "to be nothing more than a feeling of curiosity; but be it what it\n",
      "might, there it undoubtedly was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little by little, the rumours spread about town became lost in a maze\n",
      "of uncertainty. It was said that some foolish young prince, name\n",
      "unknown, had suddenly come into possession of a gigantic fortune, and\n",
      "had married a French ballet dancer. This was contradicted, and the\n",
      "rumour circulated that it was a young merchant who had come into the\n",
      "enormous fortune and married the great ballet dancer, and that at the\n",
      "wedding the drunken young fool had burned seventy thousand roubles at a\n",
      "candle out of pure bravado.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, all these rumours soon died down, to which circumstance\n",
      "certain facts largely contributed. For instance, the whole of the\n",
      "Rogojin troop had departed, with him at their head, for Moscow. This\n",
      "was exactly a week after a dreadful orgy at the Ekaterinhof gardens,\n",
      "where Nastasia Philipovna had been present. It became known that after\n",
      "this orgy Nastasia Philipovna had entirely disappeared, and that she\n",
      "had since been traced to Moscow; so that the exodus of the Rogojin band\n",
      "was found consistent with this report.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were rumours current as to Gania, too; but circumstances soon\n",
      "contradicted these. He had fallen seriously ill, and his illness\n",
      "precluded his appearance in society, and even at business, for over a\n",
      "month. As soon as he had recovered, however, he threw up his situation\n",
      "in the public company under General Epanchinâs direction, for some\n",
      "unknown reason, and the post was given to another. He never went near\n",
      "the Epanchinsâ house at all, and was exceedingly irritable and\n",
      "depressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Varvara Ardalionovna married Ptitsin this winter, and it was said that\n",
      "the fact of Ganiaâs retirement from business was the ultimate cause of\n",
      "the marriage, since Gania was now not only unable to support his\n",
      "family, but even required help himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may mention that Gania was no longer mentioned in the Epanchin\n",
      "household any more than the prince was; but that a certain circumstance\n",
      "in connection with the fatal evening at Nastasiaâs house became known\n",
      "to the general, and, in fact, to all the family the very next day. This\n",
      "fact was that Gania had come home that night, but had refused to go to\n",
      "bed. He had awaited the princeâs return from Ekaterinhof with feverish\n",
      "impatience.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the latterâs arrival, at six in the morning, Gania had gone to him\n",
      "in his room, bringing with him the singed packet of money, which he had\n",
      "insisted that the prince should return to Nastasia Philipovna without\n",
      "delay. It was said that when Gania entered the princeâs room, he came\n",
      "with anything but friendly feelings, and in a condition of despair and\n",
      "misery; but that after a short conversation, he had stayed on for a\n",
      "couple of hours with him, sobbing continuously and bitterly the whole\n",
      "time. They had parted upon terms of cordial friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Epanchins heard about this, as well as about the episode at\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovnaâs. It was strange, perhaps, that the facts should\n",
      "become so quickly, and fairly accurately, known. As far as Gania was\n",
      "concerned, it might have been supposed that the news had come through\n",
      "Varvara Ardalionovna, who had suddenly become a frequent visitor of the\n",
      "Epanchin girls, greatly to their motherâs surprise. But though Varvara\n",
      "had seen fit, for some reason, to make friends with them, it was not\n",
      "likely that she would have talked to them about her brother. She had\n",
      "plenty of pride, in spite of the fact that in thus acting she was\n",
      "seeking intimacy with people who had practically shown her brother the\n",
      "door. She and the Epanchin girls had been acquainted in childhood,\n",
      "although of late they had met but rarely. Even now Varvara hardly ever\n",
      "appeared in the drawing-room, but would slip in by a back way.\n",
      "Lizabetha Prokofievna, who disliked Varvara, although she had a great\n",
      "respect for her mother, was much annoyed by this sudden intimacy, and\n",
      "put it down to the general âcontrarinessâ of her daughters, who were\n",
      "âalways on the lookout for some new way of opposing her.â Nevertheless,\n",
      "Varvara continued her visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month after Muishkinâs departure, Mrs. Epanchin received a letter\n",
      "from her old friend Princess Bielokonski (who had lately left for\n",
      "Moscow), which letter put her into the greatest good humour. She did\n",
      "not divulge its contents either to her daughters or the general, but\n",
      "her conduct towards the former became affectionate in the extreme. She\n",
      "even made some sort of confession to them, but they were unable to\n",
      "understand what it was about. She actually relaxed towards the general\n",
      "a littleâhe had been long disgracedâand though she managed to quarrel\n",
      "with them all the next day, yet she soon came round, and from her\n",
      "general behaviour it was to be concluded that she had had good news of\n",
      "some sort, which she would like, but could not make up her mind, to\n",
      "disclose.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a week later she received another letter from the same source,\n",
      "and at last resolved to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "She solemnly announced that she had heard from old Princess\n",
      "Bielokonski, who had given her most comforting news about âthat queer\n",
      "young prince.â Her friend had hunted him up, and found that all was\n",
      "going well with him. He had since called in person upon her, making an\n",
      "extremely favourable impression, for the princess had received him each\n",
      "day since, and had introduced him into several good houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls could see that their mother concealed a great deal from them,\n",
      "and left out large pieces of the letter in reading it to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the ice was broken, and it suddenly became possible to mention\n",
      "the princeâs name again. And again it became evident how very strong\n",
      "was the impression the young man had made in the household by his one\n",
      "visit there. Mrs. Epanchin was surprised at the effect which the news\n",
      "from Moscow had upon the girls, and they were no less surprised that\n",
      "after solemnly remarking that her most striking characteristic was\n",
      "âbeing mistaken in peopleâ she should have troubled to obtain for the\n",
      "prince the favour and protection of so powerful an old lady as the\n",
      "Princess Bielokonski. As soon as the ice was thus broken, the general\n",
      "lost no time in showing that he, too, took the greatest interest in the\n",
      "subject. He admitted that he was interested, but said that it was\n",
      "merely in the business side of the question. It appeared that, in the\n",
      "interests of the prince, he had made arrangements in Moscow for a\n",
      "careful watch to be kept upon the princeâs business affairs, and\n",
      "especially upon Salaskin. All that had been said as to the prince being\n",
      "an undoubted heir to a fortune turned out to be perfectly true; but the\n",
      "fortune proved to be much smaller than was at first reported. The\n",
      "estate was considerably encumbered with debts; creditors turned up on\n",
      "all sides, and the prince, in spite of all advice and entreaty,\n",
      "insisted upon managing all matters of claim himselfâwhich, of course,\n",
      "meant satisfying everybody all round, although half the claims were\n",
      "absolutely fraudulent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin confirmed all this. She said the princess had written to\n",
      "much the same effect, and added that there was no curing a fool. But it\n",
      "was plain, from her expression of face, how strongly she approved of\n",
      "this particular young foolâs doings. In conclusion, the general\n",
      "observed that his wife took as great an interest in the prince as\n",
      "though he were her own son; and that she had commenced to be especially\n",
      "affectionate towards Aglaya was a self-evident fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this caused the general to look grave and important. But, alas!\n",
      "this agreeable state of affairs very soon changed once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of weeks went by, and suddenly the general and his wife were\n",
      "once more gloomy and silent, and the ice was as firm as ever. The fact\n",
      "was, the general, who had heard first, how Nastasia Philipovna had fled\n",
      "to Moscow and had been discovered there by Rogojin; that she had then\n",
      "disappeared once more, and been found again by Rogojin, and how after\n",
      "that she had almost promised to marry him, now received news that she\n",
      "had once more disappeared, almost on the very day fixed for her\n",
      "wedding, flying somewhere into the interior of Russia this time, and\n",
      "that Prince Muishkin had left all his affairs in the hands of Salaskin\n",
      "and disappeared alsoâbut whether he was with Nastasia, or had only set\n",
      "off in search of her, was unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizabetha Prokofievna received confirmatory news from the princessâand\n",
      "alas, two months after the princeâs first departure from St.\n",
      "Petersburg, darkness and mystery once more enveloped his whereabouts\n",
      "and actions, and in the Epanchin family the ice of silence once more\n",
      "formed over the subject. Varia, however, informed the girls of what had\n",
      "happened, she having received the news from Ptitsin, who generally knew\n",
      "more than most people.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make an end, we may say that there were many changes in the Epanchin\n",
      "household in the spring, so that it was not difficult to forget the\n",
      "prince, who sent no news of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Epanchin family had at last made up their minds to spend the summer\n",
      "abroad, all except the general, who could not waste time in âtravelling\n",
      "for enjoyment,â of course. This arrangement was brought about by the\n",
      "persistence of the girls, who insisted that they were never allowed to\n",
      "go abroad because their parents were too anxious to marry them off.\n",
      "Perhaps their parents had at last come to the conclusion that husbands\n",
      "might be found abroad, and that a summerâs travel might bear fruit. The\n",
      "marriage between Alexandra and Totski had been broken off. Since the\n",
      "princeâs departure from St. Petersburg no more had been said about it;\n",
      "the subject had been dropped without ceremony, much to the joy of Mrs.\n",
      "General, who, announced that she was âready to cross herself with both\n",
      "handsâ in gratitude for the escape. The general, however, regretted\n",
      "Totski for a long while. âSuch a fortune!â he sighed, âand such a good,\n",
      "easy-going fellow!â\n",
      "\n",
      "After a time it became known that Totski had married a French marquise,\n",
      "and was to be carried off by her to Paris, and then to Brittany.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, well,â thought the general, âheâs lost to us for good, now.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Epanchins prepared to depart for the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now another circumstance occurred, which changed all the plans once\n",
      "more, and again the intended journey was put off, much to the delight\n",
      "of the general and his spouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain Prince Sââ arrived in St. Petersburg from Moscow, an eminent\n",
      "and honourable young man. He was one of those active persons who always\n",
      "find some good work with which to employ themselves. Without forcing\n",
      "himself upon the public notice, modest and unobtrusive, this young\n",
      "prince was concerned with much that happened in the world in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had served, at first, in one of the civil departments, had then\n",
      "attended to matters connected with the local government of provincial\n",
      "towns, and had of late been a corresponding member of several important\n",
      "scientific societies. He was a man of excellent family and solid means,\n",
      "about thirty-five years of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Sââ made the acquaintance of the generalâs family, and Adelaida,\n",
      "the second girl, made a great impression upon him. Towards the spring\n",
      "he proposed to her, and she accepted him. The general and his wife were\n",
      "delighted. The journey abroad was put off, and the wedding was fixed\n",
      "for a day not very distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trip abroad might have been enjoyed later on by Mrs. Epanchin and\n",
      "her two remaining daughters, but for another circumstance.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so happened that Prince Sââ introduced a distant relation of his own\n",
      "into the Epanchin familyâone Evgenie Pavlovitch, a young officer of\n",
      "about twenty-eight years of age, whose conquests among the ladies in\n",
      "Moscow had been proverbial. This young gentleman no sooner set eyes on\n",
      "Aglaya than he became a frequent visitor at the house. He was witty,\n",
      "well-educated, and extremely wealthy, as the general very soon\n",
      "discovered. His past reputation was the only thing against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing was said; there were not even any hints dropped; but still, it\n",
      "seemed better to the parents to say nothing more about going abroad\n",
      "this season, at all events. Aglaya herself perhaps was of a different\n",
      "opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this happened just before the second appearance of our hero upon\n",
      "the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time, to judge from appearances, poor Prince Muishkin had been\n",
      "quite forgotten in St. Petersburg. If he had appeared suddenly among\n",
      "his acquaintances, he would have been received as one from the skies;\n",
      "but we must just glance at one more fact before we conclude this\n",
      "preface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colia Ivolgin, for some time after the princeâs departure, continued\n",
      "his old life. That is, he went to school, looked after his father,\n",
      "helped Varia in the house, and ran her errands, and went frequently to\n",
      "see his friend, Hippolyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lodgers had disappeared very quicklyâFerdishenko soon after the\n",
      "events at Nastasia Philipovnaâs, while the prince went to Moscow, as we\n",
      "know. Gania and his mother went to live with Varia and Ptitsin\n",
      "immediately after the latterâs wedding, while the general was housed in\n",
      "a debtorâs prison by reason of certain IOUâs given to the captainâs\n",
      "widow under the impression that they would never be formally used\n",
      "against him. This unkind action much surprised poor Ardalion\n",
      "Alexandrovitch, the victim, as he called himself, of an âunbounded\n",
      "trust in the nobility of the human heart.â\n",
      "\n",
      "When he signed those notes of hand he never dreamt that they would be a\n",
      "source of future trouble. The event showed that he was mistaken. âTrust\n",
      "in anyone after this! Have the least confidence in man or woman!â he\n",
      "cried in bitter tones, as he sat with his new friends in prison, and\n",
      "recounted to them his favourite stories of the siege of Kars, and the\n",
      "resuscitated soldier. On the whole, he accommodated himself very well\n",
      "to his new position. Ptitsin and Varia declared that he was in the\n",
      "right place, and Gania was of the same opinion. The only person who\n",
      "deplored his fate was poor Nina Alexandrovna, who wept bitter tears\n",
      "over him, to the great surprise of her household, and, though always in\n",
      "feeble health, made a point of going to see him as often as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the generalâs âmishap,â as Colia called it, and the marriage of\n",
      "his sister, the boy had quietly possessed himself of far more freedom.\n",
      "His relations saw little of him, for he rarely slept at home. He made\n",
      "many new friends; and was moreover, a frequent visitor at the debtorâs\n",
      "prison, to which he invariably accompanied his mother. Varia, who used\n",
      "to be always correcting him, never spoke to him now on the subject of\n",
      "his frequent absences, and the whole household was surprised to see\n",
      "Gania, in spite of his depression, on quite friendly terms with his\n",
      "brother. This was something new, for Gania had been wont to look upon\n",
      "Colia as a kind of errand-boy, treating him with contempt, threatening\n",
      "to âpull his ears,â and in general driving him almost wild with\n",
      "irritation. It seemed now that Gania really needed his brother, and the\n",
      "latter, for his part, felt as if he could forgive Gania much since he\n",
      "had returned the hundred thousand roubles offered to him by Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna. Three months after the departure of the prince, the Ivolgin\n",
      "family discovered that Colia had made acquaintance with the Epanchins,\n",
      "and was on very friendly terms with the daughters. Varia heard of it\n",
      "first, though Colia had not asked her to introduce him. Little by\n",
      "little the family grew quite fond of him. Madame Epanchin at first\n",
      "looked on him with disdain, and received him coldly, but in a short\n",
      "time he grew to please her, because, as she said, he âwas candid and no\n",
      "flattererââa very true description. From the first he put himself on an\n",
      "equality with his new friends, and though he sometimes read newspapers\n",
      "and books to the mistress of the house, it was simply because he liked\n",
      "to be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, however, he and Lizabetha Prokofievna quarrelled seriously\n",
      "about the âwoman question,â in the course of a lively discussion on\n",
      "that burning subject. He told her that she was a tyrant, and that he\n",
      "would never set foot in her house again. It may seem incredible, but a\n",
      "day or two after, Madame Epanchin sent a servant with a note begging\n",
      "him to return, and Colia, without standing on his dignity, did so at\n",
      "once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aglaya was the only one of the family whose good graces he could not\n",
      "gain, and who always spoke to him haughtily, but it so happened that\n",
      "the boy one day succeeded in giving the proud maiden a surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about Easter, when, taking advantage of a momentary tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte\n",
      "Colia handed Aglaya a letter, remarking that he âhad orders to deliver\n",
      "it to her privately.â She stared at him in amazement, but he did not\n",
      "wait to hear what she had to say, and went out. Aglaya broke the seal,\n",
      "and read as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "âOnce you did me the honour of giving me your confidence. Perhaps you\n",
      "have quite forgotten me now! How is it that I am writing to you? I do\n",
      "not know; but I am conscious of an irresistible desire to remind you of\n",
      "my existence, especially you. How many times I have needed all three of\n",
      "you; but only you have dwelt always in my mindâs eye. I need youâI need\n",
      "you very much. I will not write about myself. I have nothing to tell\n",
      "you. But I long for you to be happy. _Are_ you happy? That is all I\n",
      "wished to say to youâYour brother,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "âPr. L. Muishkin.â\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On reading this short and disconnected note, Aglaya suddenly blushed\n",
      "all over, and became very thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be difficult to describe her thoughts at that moment. One of\n",
      "them was, âShall I show it to anyone?â But she was ashamed to show it.\n",
      "So she ended by hiding it in her table drawer, with a very strange,\n",
      "ironical smile upon her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day, she took it out, and put it into a large book, as she usually\n",
      "did with papers which she wanted to be able to find easily. She laughed\n",
      "when, about a week later, she happened to notice the name of the book,\n",
      "and saw that it was Don Quixote, but it would be difficult to say\n",
      "exactly why.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot say, either, whether she showed the letter to her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when she had read it herself once more, it suddenly struck her that\n",
      "surely that conceited boy, Colia, had not been the one chosen\n",
      "correspondent of the prince all this while. She determined to ask him,\n",
      "and did so with an exaggerated show of carelessness. He informed her\n",
      "haughtily that though he had given the prince his permanent address\n",
      "when the latter left town, and had offered his services, the prince had\n",
      "never before given him any commission to perform, nor had he written\n",
      "until the following lines arrived, with Aglayaâs letter. Aglaya took\n",
      "the note, and read it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDEAR COLIA,âPlease be so kind as to give the enclosed sealed letter to\n",
      "Aglaya Ivanovna. Keep wellâEver your loving,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "âPr. L. Muishkin.â\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt seems absurd to trust a little pepper-box like you,â said Aglaya,\n",
      "as she returned the note, and walked past the âpepper-boxâ with an\n",
      "expression of great contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Ganiaâs\n",
      "new green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in\n",
      "order to impress her. He was very deeply mortified.\n",
      "\n",
      "II.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St.\n",
      "Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious\n",
      "country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near\n",
      "St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed\n",
      "without further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the\n",
      "family had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk,\n",
      "Prince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from\n",
      "Moscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he\n",
      "suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from\n",
      "among the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the\n",
      "eyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide\n",
      "him. It must have been a hallucination. But the disagreeable impression\n",
      "remained, and without this, the prince was sad and thoughtful already,\n",
      "and seemed to be much preoccupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "His cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya. Here he\n",
      "engaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished. He washed and\n",
      "changed, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to waste\n",
      "no time. Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he left\n",
      "Petersburg would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his\n",
      "exterior was concerned. His clothes certainly were very different; they\n",
      "were more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to\n",
      "mockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance. But\n",
      "what is there that people will not smile at?\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince took a cab and drove to a street near the Nativity, where he\n",
      "soon discovered the house he was seeking. It was a small wooden villa,\n",
      "and he was struck by its attractive and clean appearance; it stood in a\n",
      "pleasant little garden, full of flowers. The windows looking on the\n",
      "street were open, and the sound of a voice, reading aloud or making a\n",
      "speech, came through them. It rose at times to a shout, and was\n",
      "interrupted occasionally by bursts of laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Muishkin entered the court-yard, and ascended the steps. A cook\n",
      "with her sleeves turned up to the elbows opened the door. The visitor\n",
      "asked if Mr. Lebedeff were at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe is in there,â said she, pointing to the salon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room had a blue wall-paper, and was well, almost pretentiously,\n",
      "furnished, with its round table, its divan, and its bronze clock under\n",
      "a glass shade. There was a narrow pier-glass against the wall, and a\n",
      "chandelier adorned with lustres hung by a bronze chain from the\n",
      "ceiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the prince entered, Lebedeff was standing in the middle of the\n",
      "room, his back to the door. He was in his shirt-sleeves, on account of\n",
      "the extreme heat, and he seemed to have just reached the peroration of\n",
      "his speech, and was impressively beating his breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "His audience consisted of a youth of about fifteen years of age with a\n",
      "clever face, who had a book in his hand, though he was not reading; a\n",
      "young lady of twenty, in deep mourning, stood near him with an infant\n",
      "in her arms; another girl of thirteen, also in black, was laughing\n",
      "loudly, her mouth wide open; and on the sofa lay a handsome young man,\n",
      "with black hair and eyes, and a suspicion of beard and whiskers. He\n",
      "frequently interrupted the speaker and argued with him, to the great\n",
      "delight of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLukian Timofeyovitch! Lukian Timofeyovitch! Hereâs someone to see you!\n",
      "Look here!... a gentleman to speak to you!... Well, itâs not my fault!â\n",
      "and the cook turned and went away red with anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff started, and at sight of the prince stood like a statue for a\n",
      "moment. Then he moved up to him with an ingratiating smile, but stopped\n",
      "short again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPrince! ex-ex-excellency!â he stammered. Then suddenly he ran towards\n",
      "the girl with the infant, a movement so unexpected by her that she\n",
      "staggered and fell back, but next moment he was threatening the other\n",
      "child, who was standing, still laughing, in the doorway. She screamed,\n",
      "and ran towards the kitchen. Lebedeff stamped his foot angrily; then,\n",
      "seeing the prince regarding him with amazement, he murmured\n",
      "apologeticallyââPardon to show respect!... he-he!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are quite wrong...â began the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAt once... at once... in one moment!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He rushed like a whirlwind from the room, and Muishkin looked\n",
      "inquiringly at the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all laughing, and the guest joined in the chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe has gone to get his coat,â said the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow annoying!â exclaimed the prince. âI thought... Tell me, is he...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou think he is drunk?â cried the young man on the sofa. âNot in the\n",
      "least. Heâs only had three or four small glasses, perhaps five; but\n",
      "what is that? The usual thing!â\n",
      "\n",
      "As the prince opened his mouth to answer, he was interrupted by the\n",
      "girl, whose sweet face wore an expression of absolute frankness.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe never drinks much in the morning; if you have come to talk business\n",
      "with him, do it now. It is the best time. He sometimes comes back drunk\n",
      "in the evening; but just now he passes the greater part of the evening\n",
      "in tears, and reads passages of Holy Scripture aloud, because our\n",
      "mother died five weeks ago.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo doubt he ran off because he did not know what to say to you,â said\n",
      "the youth on the divan. âI bet he is trying to cheat you, and is\n",
      "thinking how best to do it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then Lebedeff returned, having put on his coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âFive weeks!â said he, wiping his eyes. âOnly five weeks! Poor\n",
      "orphans!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut why wear a coat in holes,â asked the girl, âwhen your new one is\n",
      "hanging behind the door? Did you not see it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHold your tongue, dragon-fly!â he scolded. âWhat a plague you are!â He\n",

      "chooses to kick him. But in interpreting revelation I am the equal of\n",
      "anyone, great as he may be! Such is the power of the mind and the\n",

      "when we were alone. âIs that so?â âYes,â I answered unhesitatingly, and\n",

      "first he smiled, but when we reached the numerical computations and\n",
      "correspondences, he trembled, and turned pale. Then he begged me to\n",
      "close the book, and sent me away, promising to put my name on the\n",
      "reward list. That took place as I said on the eve of Easter, and eight\n",

      "\n",
      "âWhat?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is the truth. One evening after dinner he stumbled as he stepped\n",

      "immediately. He was seventy-three years of age, and had a red face, and\n",
      "white hair; he deluged himself with scent, and was always smiling like\n",
      "a child. Peter Zakkaritch recalled my interview with him, and said,\n",

      "to Pavlofsk.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are going to Pavlofsk too?â asked the prince sharply. âEverybody\n",

      "\n",
      "âI donât know of many people going to Pavlofsk, and as for the house,\n",
      "Ivan Ptitsin has let me one of his villas rather cheaply. It is a\n",
      "pleasant place, lying on a hill surrounded by trees, and one can live\n",
      "there for a mere song. There is good music to be heard, so no wonder it\n",
      "is popular. I shall stay in the lodge. As to the villa itself...â\n",

      "âLet it to me,â said the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this was precisely what Lebedeff had made up his mind to do in the\n",

      "in fact the house was occupied at present by a chance visitor, who had\n",
      "told Lebedeff that he would perhaps take it for the summer months. The\n",
      "clerk knew very well that this â_perhaps_â meant â_certainly_,â but as\n",
      "he thought he could make more out of a tenant like the prince, he felt\n",
      "justified in speaking vaguely about the present inhabitantâs\n",
      "intentions. âThis is quite a coincidence,â thought he, and when the\n",
      "subject of price was mentioned, he made a gesture with his hand, as if\n",
      "to waive away a question of so little importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh well, as you like!â said Muishkin. âI will think it over. You shall\n",
      "lose nothing!â\n",
      "\n",
      "They were walking slowly across the garden.\n",
      "\n",

      "prince, tell you something on the subject which would interest you, I\n",
      "am sure.â He spoke in wheedling tones, and wriggled as he walked along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muishkin stopped short.\n",
      "\n",

      "should like to know when you are going to start. The sooner the better\n",
      "as far as I am concerned, for I am at an hotel.â\n",
      "\n",
      "They had left the garden now, and were crossing the yard on their way\n",

      "III.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now close on twelve oâclock.\n",
      "\n",

      "find the general, and that the latter might probably carry him straight\n",
      "off to Pavlofsk with him; whereas there was one visit he was most\n",
      "anxious to make without delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "So at the risk of missing General Epanchin altogether, and thus\n",
      "postponing his visit to Pavlofsk for a day, at least, the prince\n",
      "decided to go and look for the house he desired to find.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visit he was about to pay was, in some respects, a risky one. He\n",
      "was in two minds about it, but knowing that the house was in the\n",
      "Gorohovaya, not far from the Sadovaya, he determined to go in that\n",
      "direction, and to try to make up his mind on the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived at the point where the Gorohovaya crosses the Sadovaya, he was\n",
      "surprised to find how excessively agitated he was. He had no idea that\n",
      "his heart could beat so painfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "One house in the Gorohovaya began to attract his attention long before\n",
      "he reached it, and the prince remembered afterwards that he had said to\n",
      "himself: âThat is the house, Iâm sure of it.â He came up to it quite\n",
      "curious to discover whether he had guessed right, and felt that he\n",
      "would be disagreeably impressed to find that he had actually done so.\n",
      "The house was a large gloomy-looking structure, without the slightest\n",
      "claim to architectural beauty, in colour a dirty green. There are a few\n",
      "of these old houses, built towards the end of the last century, still\n",
      "standing in that part of St. Petersburg, and showing little change from\n",
      "their original form and colour. They are solidly built, and are\n",
      "remarkable for the thickness of their walls, and for the fewness of\n",
      "their windows, many of which are covered by gratings. On the\n",
      "ground-floor there is usually a money-changerâs shop, and the owner\n",
      "lives over it. Without as well as within, the houses seem inhospitable\n",
      "and mysteriousâan impression which is difficult to explain, unless it\n",
      "has something to do with the actual architectural style. These houses\n",
      "are almost exclusively inhabited by the merchant class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived at the gate, the prince looked up at the legend over it, which\n",
      "ran:\n",
      "\n",
      "âHouse of Rogojin, hereditary and honourable citizen.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated no longer; but opened the glazed door at the bottom of the\n",
      "outer stairs and made his way up to the second storey. The place was\n",
      "dark and gloomy-looking; the walls of the stone staircase were painted\n",
      "a dull red. Rogojin and his mother and brother occupied the whole of\n",
      "the second floor. The servant who opened the door to Muishkin led him,\n",
      "without taking his name, through several rooms and up and down many\n",
      "steps until they arrived at a door, where he knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parfen Rogojin opened the door himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "On seeing the prince he became deadly white, and apparently fixed to\n",
      "the ground, so that he was more like a marble statue than a human\n",
      "being. The prince had expected some surprise, but Rogojin evidently\n",
      "considered his visit an impossible and miraculous event. He stared with\n",
      "an expression almost of terror, and his lips twisted into a bewildered\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âParfen! perhaps my visit is ill-timed. IâI can go away again if you\n",
      "like,â said Muishkin at last, rather embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, no; itâs all right, come in,â said Parfen, recollecting himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were evidently on quite familiar terms. In Moscow they had had\n",
      "many occasions of meeting; indeed, some few of those meetings were but\n",
      "too vividly impressed upon their memories. They had not met now,\n",
      "however, for three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deathlike pallor, and a sort of slight convulsion about the lips,\n",
      "had not left Rogojinâs face. Though he welcomed his guest, he was still\n",
      "obviously much disturbed. As he invited the prince to sit down near the\n",
      "table, the latter happened to turn towards him, and was startled by the\n",
      "strange expression on his face. A painful recollection flashed into his\n",
      "mind. He stood for a time, looking straight at Rogojin, whose eyes\n",
      "seemed to blaze like fire. At last Rogojin smiled, though he still\n",
      "looked agitated and shaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat are you staring at me like that for?â he muttered. âSit down.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince took a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "âParfen,â he said, âtell me honestly, did you know that I was coming to\n",
      "Petersburg or no?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, I supposed you were coming,â the other replied, smiling\n",
      "sarcastically, âand I was right in my supposition, you see; but how was\n",
      "I to know that you would come _today?_â\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain strangeness and impatience in his manner impressed the prince\n",
      "very forcibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd if you had known that I was coming today, why be so irritated\n",
      "about it?â he asked, in quiet surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy did you ask me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBecause when I jumped out of the train this morning, two eyes glared\n",
      "at me just as yours did a moment since.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHa! and whose eyes may they have been?â said Rogojin, suspiciously. It\n",
      "seemed to the prince that he was trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât know; I thought it was a hallucination. I often have\n",
      "hallucinations nowadays. I feel just as I did five years ago when my\n",
      "fits were about to come on.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, perhaps it was a hallucination, I donât know,â said Parfen.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried to give the prince an affectionate smile, and it seemed to the\n",
      "latter as though in this smile of his something had broken, and that he\n",
      "could not mend it, try as he would.\n",
      "\n",
      "âShall you go abroad again then?â he asked, and suddenly added, âDo you\n",
      "remember how we came up in the train from Pskoff together? You and your\n",
      "cloak and leggings, eh?â\n",
      "\n",
      "And Rogojin burst out laughing, this time with unconcealed malice, as\n",
      "though he were glad that he had been able to find an opportunity for\n",
      "giving vent to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHave you quite taken up your quarters here?â asked the prince\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, Iâm at home. Where else should I go to?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWe havenât met for some time. Meanwhile I have heard things about you\n",
      "which I should not have believed to be possible.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat of that? People will say anything,â said Rogojin drily.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAt all events, youâve disbanded your troopâand you are living in your\n",
      "own house instead of being fast and loose about the place; thatâs all\n",
      "very good. Is this house all yours, or joint property?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is my motherâs. You get to her apartments by that passage.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhereâs your brother?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIn the other wing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs he married?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWidower. Why do you want to know all this?â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince looked at him, but said nothing. He had suddenly relapsed\n",
      "into musing, and had probably not heard the question at all. Rogojin\n",
      "did not insist upon an answer, and there was silence for a few moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI guessed which was your house from a hundred yards off,â said the\n",
      "prince at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy so?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât quite know. Your house has the aspect of yourself and all your\n",
      "family; it bears the stamp of the Rogojin life; but ask me why I think\n",
      "so, and I can tell you nothing. It is nonsense, of course. I am nervous\n",
      "about this kind of thing troubling me so much. I had never before\n",
      "imagined what sort of a house you would live in, and yet no sooner did\n",
      "I set eyes on this one than I said to myself that it must be yours.â\n",
      "\n",

      "The room they were now sitting in was a large one, lofty but dark, well\n",
      "furnished, principally with writing-tables and desks covered with\n",
      "papers and books. A wide sofa covered with red morocco evidently served\n",
      "Rogojin for a bed. On the table beside which the prince had been\n",
      "invited to seat himself lay some books; one containing a marker where\n",
      "the reader had left off, was a volume of Solovieffâs History. Some\n",
      "oil-paintings in worn gilded frames hung on the walls, but it was\n",
      "impossible to make out what subjects they represented, so blackened\n",
      "were they by smoke and age. One, a life-sized portrait, attracted the\n",
      "princeâs attention. It showed a man of about fifty, wearing a long\n",
      "riding-coat of German cut. He had two medals on his breast; his beard\n",
      "was white, short and thin; his face yellow and wrinkled, with a sly,\n",

      "\n",
      "âThat is your father, is it not?â asked the prince.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "you once before on a very similar occasion. When you were arranging for\n",
      "your projected marriage in Moscow, I did not interfere with youâyou\n",
      "know I did not. That first time she fled to me from you, from the very\n",
      "altar almost, and begged me to âsave her from you.â Afterwards she ran\n",
      "away from me again, and you found her and arranged your marriage with\n",
      "her once more; and now, I hear, she has run away from you and come to\n",
      "Petersburg. Is it true? Lebedeff wrote me to this effect, and thatâs\n",
      "why I came here. That you had once more arranged matters with Nastasia\n",

      "change badly. I did not intend to take her abroad myself. I was going\n",
      "to arrange for her to go without me. Now I tell you honestly, Parfen,\n",
      "if it is true that all is made up between you, I will not so much as\n",
      "set eyes upon her, and I will never even come to see you again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou know quite well that I am telling the truth, because I have always\n",
      "been frank with you. I have never concealed my own opinion from you. I\n",
      "have always told you that I consider a marriage between you and her\n",
      "would be ruin to her. You would also be ruined, and perhaps even more\n",
      "hopelessly. If this marriage were to be broken off again, I admit I\n",
      "should be greatly pleased; but at the same time I have not the\n",
      "slightest intention of trying to part you. You may be quite easy in\n",
      "your mind, and you need not suspect me. You know yourself whether I was\n",
      "ever really your rival or not, even when she ran away and came to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere, you are laughing at meâI know why you laugh. It is perfectly\n",
      "true that we lived apart from one another all the time, in different\n",
      "towns. I told you before that I did not love her with love, but with\n",
      "pity! You said then that you understood me; did you really understand\n",
      "me or not? What hatred there is in your eyes at this moment! I came to\n",
      "relieve your mind, because you are dear to me also. I love you very\n",

      "pity. I have no pity for her. She hates meâthatâs the plain truth of\n",
      "the matter. I dream of her every night, and always that she is laughing\n",
      "at me with another man. And so she does laugh at me. She thinks no more\n",
      "of marrying me than if she were changing her shoe. Would you believe\n",

      "âIt is not like her, you say? My friend, thatâs absurd. Perhaps such an\n",
      "act would horrify her, if she were with you, but it is quite different\n",
      "where I am concerned. She looks on me as vermin. Her affair with Keller\n",
      "was simply to make a laughing-stock of me. You donât know what a fool\n",

      "this herself,â he said, with a peculiar glance at Muishkin. âI think\n",

      "for some reason or other; but at other times sheâs angry, and wonât say\n",
      "a word, and thatâs what Iâm afraid of. I took her a shawl one day, the\n",
      "like of which she might never have seen, although she did live in\n",

      "laughs when sheâs with me. We went all over this old house together. âI\n",

      "\n",
      "They passed through the same rooms which the prince had traversed on\n",
      "his arrival. In the largest there were pictures on the walls, portraits\n",
      "and landscapes of little interest. Over the door, however, there was\n",
      "one of strange and rather striking shape; it was six or seven feet in\n",
      "length, and not more than a foot in height. It represented the Saviour\n",
      "just taken from the cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince glanced at it, but took no further notice. He moved on\n",
      "hastily, as though anxious to get out of the house. But Rogojin\n",
      "suddenly stopped underneath the picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMy father picked up all these pictures very cheap at auctions, and so\n",
      "on,â he said; âthey are all rubbish, except the one over the door, and\n",
      "that is valuable. A man offered five hundred roubles for it last week.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYesâthatâs a copy of a Holbein,â said the prince, looking at it again,\n",
      "âand a good copy, too, so far as I am able to judge. I saw the picture\n",
      "abroad, and could not forget itâwhatâs the matter?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin had dropped the subject of the picture and walked on. Of course\n",
      "his strange frame of mind was sufficient to account for his conduct;\n",

      "drop a conversation commenced by himself. Rogojin did not take any\n",
      "notice of his question.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLef Nicolaievitch,â said Rogojin, after a pause, during which the two\n",

      "believe in God?â\n",
      "\n",

      "apparently, that the prince had not answered his question.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat picture! That picture!â cried Muishkin, struck by a sudden idea.\n",
      "âWhy, a manâs faith might be ruined by looking at that picture!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo it is!â said Rogojin, unexpectedly. They had now reached the front\n",

      "\n",
      "The prince stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow?â he said. âWhat do you mean? I was half joking, and you took me\n",
      "up quite seriously! Why do you ask me whether I believe in God?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, no particular reason. I meant to ask you beforeâmany people are\n",

      "\n",
      "Rogojin laughed bitterly as he said these words, and opening the door,\n",
      "held it for the prince to pass out. Muishkin looked surprised, but went\n",
      "out. The other followed him as far as the landing of the outer stairs,\n",
      "and shut the door behind him. They both now stood facing one another,\n",
      "as though oblivious of where they were, or what they had to do next.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, good-bye!â said the prince, holding out his hand.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âAs to faith,â he said, smiling, and evidently unwilling to leave\n",
      "Rogojin in this stateââas to faith, I had four curious conversations in\n",
      "two days, a week or so ago. One morning I met a man in the train, and\n",
      "made acquaintance with him at once. I had often heard of him as a very\n",
      "learned man, but an atheist; and I was very glad of the opportunity of\n",
      "conversing with so eminent and clever a person. He doesnât believe in\n",
      "God, and he talked a good deal about it, but all the while it appeared\n",
      "to me that he was speaking _outside the subject_. And it has always\n",
      "struck me, both in speaking to such men and in reading their books,\n",
      "that they do not seem really to be touching on that at all, though on\n",
      "the surface they may appear to do so. I told him this, but I dare say I\n",
      "did not clearly express what I meant, for he could not understand me.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat same evening I stopped at a small provincial hotel, and it so\n",
      "happened that a dreadful murder had been committed there the night\n",
      "before, and everybody was talking about it. Two peasantsâelderly men\n",
      "and old friendsâhad had tea together there the night before, and were\n",
      "to occupy the same bedroom. They were not drunk but one of them had\n",
      "noticed for the first time that his friend possessed a silver watch\n",
      "which he was wearing on a chain. He was by no means a thief, and was,\n",
      "as peasants go, a rich man; but this watch so fascinated him that he\n",
      "could not restrain himself. He took a knife, and when his friend turned\n",
      "his back, he came up softly behind, raised his eyes to heaven, crossed\n",
      "himself, and saying earnestlyââGod forgive me, for Christâs sake!â he\n",
      "cut his friendâs throat like a sheep, and took the watch.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin roared with laughter. He laughed as though he were in a sort of\n",
      "fit. It was strange to see him laughing so after the sombre mood he had\n",
      "been in just before.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, I like that! That beats anything!â he cried convulsively, panting\n",
      "for breath. âOne is an absolute unbeliever; the other is such a\n",
      "thorough-going believer that he murders his friend to the tune of a\n",
      "prayer! Oh, prince, prince, thatâs too good for anything! You canât\n",
      "have invented it. Itâs the best thing Iâve heard!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNext morning I went out for a stroll through the town,â continued the\n",
      "prince, so soon as Rogojin was a little quieter, though his laughter\n",
      "still burst out at intervals, âand soon observed a drunken-looking\n",
      "soldier staggering about the pavement. He came up to me and said, âBuy\n",
      "my silver cross, sir! You shall have it for fourpenceâitâs real\n",
      "silver.â I looked, and there he held a cross, just taken off his own\n",
      "neck, evidently, a large tin one, made after the Byzantine pattern. I\n",
      "fished out fourpence, and put his cross on my own neck, and I could see\n",
      "by his face that he was as pleased as he could be at the thought that\n",
      "he had succeeded in cheating a foolish gentleman, and away he went to\n",
      "drink the value of his cross. At that time everything that I saw made a\n",
      "tremendous impression upon me. I had understood nothing about Russia\n",
      "before, and had only vague and fantastic memories of it. So I thought,\n",
      "âI will wait awhile before I condemn this Judas. Only God knows what\n",
      "may be hidden in the hearts of drunkards.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, I went homewards, and near the hotel I came across a poor woman,\n",
      "carrying a childâa baby of some six weeks old. The mother was quite a\n",
      "girl herself. The baby was smiling up at her, for the first time in its\n",
      "life, just at that moment; and while I watched the woman she suddenly\n",
      "crossed herself, oh, so devoutly! âWhat is it, my good woman?â I asked\n",
      "her. (I was never but asking questions then!) âExactly as is a motherâs\n",
      "joy when her baby smiles for the first time into her eyes, so is Godâs\n",
      "joy when one of His children turns and prays to Him for the first time,\n",
      "with all his heart!â This is what that poor woman said to me, almost\n",
      "word for word; and such a deep, refined, truly religious thought it\n",
      "wasâa thought in which the whole essence of Christianity was expressed\n",
      "in one flashâthat is, the recognition of God as our Father, and of\n",
      "Godâs joy in men as His own children, which is the chief idea of\n",
      "Christ. She was a simple country-womanâa mother, itâs trueâand perhaps,\n",

      "\n",
      "âListen, Parfen; you put a question to me just now. This is my reply.\n",

      "atheism, or crime, or acts of any kindâit has nothing to do with these\n",
      "thingsâand never had. There is something besides all this, something\n",
      "which the arguments of the atheists can never touch. But the principal\n",
      "thing, and the conclusion of my argument, is that this is most clearly\n",
      "seen in the heart of a Russian. This is a conviction which I have\n",
      "gained while I have been in this Russia of ours. Yes, Parfen! there is\n",
      "work to be done; there is work to be done in this Russian world!\n",
      "Remember what talks we used to have in Moscow! And I never wished to\n",
      "come here at all; and I never thought to meet you like this, Parfen!\n",
      "Well, wellâgood-byeâgood-bye! God be with you!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned and went downstairs.\n",
      "\n",

      "you?â\n",
      "\n",

      "âGive it to me,â said Parfen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy? do youââ\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince would rather have kept this particular cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâll wear it; and you shall have mine. Iâll take it off at once.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou wish to exchange crosses? Very well, Parfen, if thatâs the case,\n",
      "Iâm glad enoughâthat makes us brothers, you know.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince took off his tin cross, Parfen his gold one, and the\n",
      "exchange was made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parfen was silent. With sad surprise the prince observed that the look\n",
      "of distrust, the bitter, ironical smile, had still not altogether left\n",
      "his newly-adopted brotherâs face. At moments, at all events, it showed\n",
      "itself but too plainly,\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Rogojin took the princeâs hand, and stood so for some moments,\n",
      "as though he could not make up his mind. Then he drew him along,\n",
      "murmuring almost inaudibly,\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome!â\n",
      "\n",
      "They stopped on the landing, and rang the bell at a door opposite to\n",
      "Parfenâs own lodging.\n",
      "\n",
      "An old woman opened to them and bowed low to Parfen, who asked her some\n",
      "questions hurriedly, but did not wait to hear her answer. He led the\n",
      "prince on through several dark, cold-looking rooms, spotlessly clean,\n",
      "with white covers over all the furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without the ceremony of knocking, Parfen entered a small apartment,\n",
      "furnished like a drawing-room, but with a polished mahogany partition\n",
      "dividing one half of it from what was probably a bedroom. In one corner\n",
      "of this room sat an old woman in an arm-chair, close to the stove. She\n",
      "did not look very old, and her face was a pleasant, round one; but she\n",
      "was white-haired and, as one could detect at the first glance, quite in\n",
      "her second childhood. She wore a black woollen dress, with a black\n",
      "handkerchief round her neck and shoulders, and a white cap with black\n",
      "ribbons. Her feet were raised on a footstool. Beside her sat another\n",
      "old woman, also dressed in mourning, and silently knitting a stocking;\n",
      "this was evidently a companion. They both looked as though they never\n",
      "broke the silence. The first old woman, so soon as she saw Rogojin and\n",
      "the prince, smiled and bowed courteously several times, in token of her\n",
      "gratification at their visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMother,â said Rogojin, kissing her hand, âhere is my great friend,\n",
      "Prince Muishkin; we have exchanged crosses; he was like a real brother\n",
      "to me at Moscow at one time, and did a great deal for me. Bless him,\n",
      "mother, as you would bless your own son. Wait a moment, let me arrange\n",
      "your hands for you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "But the old lady, before Parfen had time to touch her, raised her right\n",
      "hand, and, with three fingers held up, devoutly made the sign of the\n",
      "cross three times over the prince. She then nodded her head kindly at\n",
      "him once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere, come along, Lef Nicolaievitch; thatâs all I brought you here\n",
      "for,â said Rogojin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the stairs again he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "âShe understood nothing of what I said to her, and did not know what I\n",
      "wanted her to do, and yet she blessed you; that shows she wished to do\n",
      "so herself. Well, goodbye; itâs time you went, and I must go too.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened his own door.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, let me at least embrace you and say goodbye, you strange\n",
      "fellow!â cried the prince, looking with gentle reproach at Rogojin, and\n",
      "advancing towards him. But the latter had hardly raised his arms when\n",
      "he dropped them again. He could not make up his mind to it; he turned\n",
      "away from the prince in order to avoid looking at him. He could not\n",
      "embrace him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDonât be afraid,â he muttered, indistinctly, âthough I have taken your\n",
      "cross, I shall not murder you for your watch.â So saying, he laughed\n",
      "suddenly, and strangely. Then in a moment his face became transfigured;\n",
      "he grew deadly white, his lips trembled, his eyes burned like fire. He\n",
      "stretched out his arms and held the prince tightly to him, and said in\n",
      "a strangled voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, take her! Itâs Fate! Sheâs yours. I surrender her.... Remember\n",
      "Rogojin!â And pushing the prince from him, without looking back at him,\n",
      "he hurriedly entered his own flat, and banged the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "V.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was late now, nearly half-past two, and the prince did not find\n",
      "General Epanchin at home. He left a card, and determined to look up\n",
      "Colia, who had a room at a small hotel near. Colia was not in, but he\n",
      "was informed that he might be back shortly, and had left word that if\n",
      "he were not in by half-past three it was to be understood that he had\n",
      "gone to Pavlofsk to General Epanchinâs, and would dine there. The\n",
      "prince decided to wait till half-past three, and ordered some dinner.\n",
      "At half-past three there was no sign of Colia. The prince waited until\n",
      "four oâclock, and then strolled off mechanically wherever his feet\n",
      "should carry him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early summer there are often magnificent days in St.\n",
      "Petersburgâbright, hot and still. This happened to be such a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time the prince wandered about without aim or object. He did\n",
      "not know the town well. He stopped to look about him on bridges, at\n",
      "street corners. He entered a confectionerâs shop to rest, once. He was\n",
      "in a state of nervous excitement and perturbation; he noticed nothing\n",
      "and no one; and he felt a craving for solitude, to be alone with his\n",
      "thoughts and his emotions, and to give himself up to them passively. He\n",
      "loathed the idea of trying to answer the questions that would rise up\n",
      "in his heart and mind. âI am not to blame for all this,â he thought to\n",
      "himself, half unconsciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards six oâclock he found himself at the station of the\n",
      "Tsarsko-Selski railway.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was tired of solitude now; a new rush of feeling took hold of him,\n",
      "and a flood of light chased away the gloom, for a moment, from his\n",
      "soul. He took a ticket to Pavlofsk, and determined to get there as fast\n",
      "as he could, but something stopped him; a reality, and not a fantasy,\n",
      "as he was inclined to think it. He was about to take his place in a\n",
      "carriage, when he suddenly threw away his ticket and came out again,\n",
      "disturbed and thoughtful. A few moments later, in the street, he\n",
      "recalled something that had bothered him all the afternoon. He caught\n",
      "himself engaged in a strange occupation which he now recollected he had\n",
      "taken up at odd moments for the last few hoursâit was looking about all\n",
      "around him for something, he did not know what. He had forgotten it for\n",
      "a while, half an hour or so, and now, suddenly, the uneasy search had\n",
      "recommenced.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had hardly become conscious of this curious phenomenon, when\n",
      "another recollection suddenly swam through his brain, interesting him\n",
      "for the moment, exceedingly. He remembered that the last time he had\n",
      "been engaged in looking around him for the unknown something, he was\n",
      "standing before a cutlerâs shop, in the window of which were exposed\n",
      "certain goods for sale. He was extremely anxious now to discover\n",
      "whether this shop and these goods really existed, or whether the whole\n",
      "thing had been a hallucination.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt in a very curious condition today, a condition similar to that\n",
      "which had preceded his fits in bygone years.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remembered that at such times he had been particularly absentminded,\n",
      "and could not discriminate between objects and persons unless he\n",
      "concentrated special attention upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remembered seeing something in the window marked at sixty copecks.\n",
      "Therefore, if the shop existed and if this object were really in the\n",
      "window, it would prove that he had been able to concentrate his\n",
      "attention on this article at a moment when, as a general rule, his\n",
      "absence of mind would have been too great to admit of any such\n",
      "concentration; in fact, very shortly after he had left the railway\n",
      "station in such a state of agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he walked back looking about him for the shop, and his heart beat\n",
      "with intolerable impatience. Ah! here was the very shop, and there was\n",
      "the article marked â60 cop.â Of course, itâs sixty copecks, he thought,\n",
      "and certainly worth no more. This idea amused him and he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was a hysterical laugh; he was feeling terribly oppressed. He\n",
      "remembered clearly that just here, standing before this window, he had\n",
      "suddenly turned round, just as earlier in the day he had turned and\n",
      "found the dreadful eyes of Rogojin fixed upon him. Convinced,\n",
      "therefore, that in this respect at all events he had been under no\n",
      "delusion, he left the shop and went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "This must be thought out; it was clear that there had been no\n",
      "hallucination at the station then, either; something had actually\n",
      "happened to him, on both occasions; there was no doubt of it. But again\n",
      "a loathing for all mental exertion overmastered him; he would not think\n",
      "it out now, he would put it off and think of something else. He\n",
      "remembered that during his epileptic fits, or rather immediately\n",
      "preceding them, he had always experienced a moment or two when his\n",
      "whole heart, and mind, and body seemed to wake up to vigour and light;\n",
      "when he became filled with joy and hope, and all his anxieties seemed\n",
      "to be swept away for ever; these moments were but presentiments, as it\n",
      "were, of the one final second (it was never more than a second) in\n",
      "which the fit came upon him. That second, of course, was inexpressible.\n",
      "When his attack was over, and the prince reflected on his symptoms, he\n",
      "used to say to himself: âThese moments, short as they are, when I feel\n",
      "such extreme consciousness of myself, and consequently more of life\n",
      "than at other times, are due only to the diseaseâto the sudden rupture\n",
      "of normal conditions. Therefore they are not really a higher kind of\n",
      "life, but a lower.â This reasoning, however, seemed to end in a\n",
      "paradox, and lead to the further consideration:ââWhat matter though it\n",
      "be only disease, an abnormal tension of the brain, if when I recall and\n",
      "analyze the moment, it seems to have been one of harmony and beauty in\n",
      "the highest degreeâan instant of deepest sensation, overflowing with\n",
      "unbounded joy and rapture, ecstatic devotion, and completest life?â\n",
      "Vague though this sounds, it was perfectly comprehensible to Muishkin,\n",
      "though he knew that it was but a feeble expression of his sensations.\n",
      "\n",
      "That there was, indeed, beauty and harmony in those abnormal moments,\n",
      "that they really contained the highest synthesis of life, he could not\n",
      "doubt, nor even admit the possibility of doubt. He felt that they were\n",
      "not analogous to the fantastic and unreal dreams due to intoxication by\n",
      "hashish, opium or wine. Of that he could judge, when the attack was\n",
      "over. These instants were characterizedâto define it in a wordâby an\n",
      "intense quickening of the sense of personality. Since, in the last\n",
      "conscious moment preceding the attack, he could say to himself, with\n",
      "full understanding of his words: âI would give my whole life for this\n",
      "one instant,â then doubtless to him it really was worth a lifetime. For\n",
      "the rest, he thought the dialectical part of his argument of little\n",
      "worth; he saw only too clearly that the result of these ecstatic\n",
      "moments was stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy. No argument was\n",
      "possible on that point. His conclusion, his estimate of the âmoment,â\n",
      "doubtless contained some error, yet the reality of the sensation\n",
      "troubled him. Whatâs more unanswerable than a fact? And this fact had\n",
      "occurred. The prince had confessed unreservedly to himself that the\n",
      "feeling of intense beatitude in that crowded moment made the moment\n",
      "worth a lifetime. âI feel then,â he said one day to Rogojin in Moscow,\n",
      "âI feel then as if I understood those amazing wordsââThere shall be no\n",
      "more time.ââ And he added with a smile: âNo doubt the epileptic Mahomet\n",
      "refers to that same moment when he says that he visited all the\n",
      "dwellings of Allah, in less time than was needed to empty his pitcher\n",
      "of water.â Yes, he had often met Rogojin in Moscow, and many were the\n",
      "subjects they discussed. âHe told me I had been a brother to him,â\n",
      "thought the prince. âHe said so today, for the first time.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He was sitting in the Summer Garden on a seat under a tree, and his\n",
      "mind dwelt on the matter. It was about seven oâclock, and the place was\n",
      "empty. The stifling atmosphere foretold a storm, and the prince felt a\n",
      "certain charm in the contemplative mood which possessed him. He found\n",
      "pleasure, too, in gazing at the exterior objects around him. All the\n",
      "time he was trying to forget some thing, to escape from some idea that\n",
      "haunted him; but melancholy thoughts came back, though he would so\n",
      "willingly have escaped from them. He remembered suddenly how he had\n",
      "been talking to the waiter, while he dined, about a recently committed\n",
      "murder which the whole town was discussing, and as he thought of it\n",
      "something strange came over him. He was seized all at once by a violent\n",
      "desire, almost a temptation, against which he strove in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped up and walked off as fast as he could towards the âPetersburg\n",
      "Side.â [One of the quarters of St. Petersburg.] He had asked someone, a\n",
      "little while before, to show him which was the Petersburg Side, on the\n",
      "banks of the Neva. He had not gone there, however; and he knew very\n",
      "well that it was of no use to go now, for he would certainly not find\n",
      "Lebedeffâs relation at home. He had the address, but she must certainly\n",
      "have gone to Pavlofsk, or Colia would have let him know. If he were to\n",
      "go now, it would merely be out of curiosity, but a sudden, new idea had\n",
      "come into his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it was something to move on and know where he was going. A\n",
      "minute later he was still moving on, but without knowing anything. He\n",
      "could no longer think out his new idea. He tried to take an interest in\n",
      "all he saw; in the sky, in the Neva. He spoke to some children he met.\n",
      "He felt his epileptic condition becoming more and more developed. The\n",
      "evening was very close; thunder was heard some way off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was haunted all that day by the face of Lebedeffâs nephew\n",
      "whom he had seen for the first time that morning, just as one is\n",
      "haunted at times by some persistent musical refrain. By a curious\n",
      "association of ideas, the young man always appeared as the murderer of\n",
      "whom Lebedeff had spoken when introducing him to Muishkin. Yes, he had\n",
      "read something about the murder, and that quite recently. Since he came\n",
      "to Russia, he had heard many stories of this kind, and was interested\n",
      "in them. His conversation with the waiter, an hour ago, chanced to be\n",
      "on the subject of this murder of the Zemarins, and the latter had\n",
      "agreed with him about it. He thought of the waiter again, and decided\n",
      "that he was no fool, but a steady, intelligent man: though, said he to\n",
      "himself, âGod knows what he may really be; in a country with which one\n",
      "is unfamiliar it is difficult to understand the people one meets.â He\n",
      "was beginning to have a passionate faith in the Russian soul, however,\n",
      "and what discoveries he had made in the last six months, what\n",
      "unexpected discoveries! But every soul is a mystery, and depths of\n",
      "mystery lie in the soul of a Russian. He had been intimate with\n",
      "Rogojin, for example, and a brotherly friendship had sprung up between\n",
      "themâyet did he really know him? What chaos and ugliness fills the\n",
      "world at times! What a self-satisfied rascal is that nephew of\n",
      "Lebedeffâs! âBut what am I thinking,â continued the prince to himself.\n",
      "âCan he really have committed that crime? Did he kill those six\n",
      "persons? I seem to be confusing things... how strange it all is.... My\n",
      "head goes round... And Lebedeffâs daughterâhow sympathetic and charming\n",
      "her face was as she held the child in her arms! What an innocent look\n",
      "and child-like laugh she had! It is curious that I had forgotten her\n",
      "until now. I expect Lebedeff adores herâand I really believe, when I\n",
      "think of it, that as sure as two and two make four, he is fond of that\n",
      "nephew, too!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, why should he judge them so hastily! Could he really say what\n",
      "they were, after one short visit? Even Lebedeff seemed an enigma today.\n",
      "Did he expect to find him so? He had never seen him like that before.\n",
      "Lebedeff and the Comtesse du Barry! Good Heavens! If Rogojin should\n",
      "really kill someone, it would not, at any rate, be such a senseless,\n",
      "chaotic affair. A knife made to a special pattern, and six people\n",
      "killed in a kind of delirium. But Rogojin also had a knife made to a\n",
      "special pattern. Can it be that Rogojin wishes to murder anyone? The\n",
      "prince began to tremble violently. âIt is a crime on my part to imagine\n",
      "anything so base, with such cynical frankness.â His face reddened with\n",
      "shame at the thought; and then there came across him as in a flash the\n",
      "memory of the incidents at the Pavlofsk station, and at the other\n",
      "station in the morning; and the question asked him by Rogojin about\n",
      "_the eyes_ and Rogojinâs cross, that he was even now wearing; and the\n",
      "benediction of Rogojinâs mother; and his embrace on the darkened\n",
      "staircaseâthat last supreme renunciationâand now, to find himself full\n",
      "of this new âidea,â staring into shop-windows, and looking round for\n",
      "thingsâhow base he was!\n",
      "\n",
      "Despair overmastered his soul; he would not go on, he would go back to\n",
      "his hotel; he even turned and went the other way; but a moment after he\n",
      "changed his mind again and went on in the old direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, here he was on the Petersburg Side already, quite close to the\n",
      "house! Where was his âideaâ? He was marching along without it now. Yes,\n",
      "his malady was coming back, it was clear enough; all this gloom and\n",
      "heaviness, all these âideas,â were nothing more nor less than a fit\n",
      "coming on; perhaps he would have a fit this very day.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just now all the gloom and darkness had fled, his heart felt full\n",
      "of joy and hope, there was no such thing as doubt. And yes, he hadnât\n",
      "seen her for so long; he really must see her. He wished he could meet\n",
      "Rogojin; he would take his hand, and they would go to her together. His\n",
      "heart was pure, he was no rival of Parfenâs. Tomorrow, he would go and\n",
      "tell him that he had seen her. Why, he had only come for the sole\n",
      "purpose of seeing her, all the way from Moscow! Perhaps she might be\n",
      "here still, who knows? She might not have gone away to Pavlofsk yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, all this must be put straight and above-board, there must be no\n",
      "more passionate renouncements, such as Rogojinâs. It must all be clear\n",
      "as day. Cannot Rogojinâs soul bear the light? He said he did not love\n",
      "her with sympathy and pity; true, he added that âyour pity is greater\n",
      "than my love,â but he was not quite fair on himself there. Kin! Rogojin\n",
      "reading a bookâwasnât that sympathy beginning? Did it not show that he\n",
      "comprehended his relations with her? And his story of waiting day and\n",
      "night for her forgiveness? That didnât look quite like passion alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion? Could her\n",
      "face inspire passion at all now? Oh, it inspired suffering, grief,\n",
      "overwhelming grief of the soul! A poignant, agonizing memory swept over\n",
      "the princeâs heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, agonizing. He remembered how he had suffered that first day when\n",
      "he thought he observed in her the symptoms of madness. He had almost\n",
      "fallen into despair. How could he have lost his hold upon her when she\n",
      "ran away from him to Rogojin? He ought to have run after her himself,\n",
      "rather than wait for news as he had done. Can Rogojin have failed to\n",
      "observe, up to now, that she is mad? Rogojin attributes her strangeness\n",
      "to other causes, to passion! What insane jealousy! What was it he had\n",
      "hinted at in that suggestion of his? The prince suddenly blushed, and\n",
      "shuddered to his very heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why recall all this? There was insanity on both sides. For him, the\n",
      "prince, to love this woman with passion, was unthinkable. It would be\n",
      "cruel and inhuman. Yes. Rogojin is not fair to himself; he has a large\n",
      "heart; he has aptitude for sympathy. When he learns the truth, and\n",
      "finds what a pitiable being is this injured, broken, half-insane\n",
      "creature, he will forgive her all the torment she has caused him. He\n",
      "will become her slave, her brother, her friend. Compassion will teach\n",
      "even Rogojin, it will show him how to reason. Compassion is the chief\n",
      "law of human existence. Oh, how guilty he felt towards Rogojin! And,\n",
      "for a few warm, hasty words spoken in Moscow, Parfen had called him\n",
      "âbrother,â while heâbut no, this was delirium! It would all come right!\n",
      "That gloomy Parfen had implied that his faith was waning; he must\n",
      "suffer dreadfully. He said he liked to look at that picture; it was not\n",
      "that he liked it, but he felt the need of looking at it. Rogojin was\n",
      "not merely a passionate soul; he was a fighter. He was fighting for the\n",
      "restoration of his dying faith. He must have something to hold on to\n",
      "and believe, and someone to believe in. What a strange picture that of\n",
      "Holbeinâs is! Why, this is the street, and hereâs the house, No. 16.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince rang the bell, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna. The lady\n",
      "of the house came out, and stated that Nastasia had gone to stay with\n",
      "Daria Alexeyevna at Pavlofsk, and might be there some days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Filisoff was a little woman of forty, with a cunning face, and\n",
      "crafty, piercing eyes. When, with an air of mystery, she asked her\n",
      "visitorâs name, he refused at first to answer, but in a moment he\n",
      "changed his mind, and left strict instructions that it should be given\n",
      "to Nastasia Philipovna. The urgency of his request seemed to impress\n",
      "Madame Filisoff, and she put on a knowing expression, as if to say,\n",
      "âYou need not be afraid, I quite understand.â The princeâs name\n",
      "evidently was a great surprise to her. He stood and looked absently at\n",
      "her for a moment, then turned, and took the road back to his hotel. But\n",
      "he went away not as he came. A great change had suddenly come over him.\n",
      "He went blindly forward; his knees shook under him; he was tormented by\n",
      "âideasâ; his lips were blue, and trembled with a feeble, meaningless\n",
      "smile. His demon was upon him once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "What had happened to him? Why was his brow clammy with drops of\n",
      "moisture, his knees shaking beneath him, and his soul oppressed with a\n",
      "cold gloom? Was it because he had just seen these dreadful eyes again?\n",
      "Why, he had left the Summer Garden on purpose to see them; that had\n",
      "been his âidea.â He had wished to assure himself that he would see them\n",
      "once more at that house. Then why was he so overwhelmed now, having\n",
      "seen them as he expected? just as though he had not expected to see\n",
      "them! Yes, they were the very same eyes; and no doubt about it. The\n",
      "same that he had seen in the crowd that morning at the station, the\n",
      "same that he had surprised in Rogojinâs rooms some hours later, when\n",
      "the latter had replied to his inquiry with a sneering laugh, âWell,\n",
      "whose eyes were they?â Then for the third time they had appeared just\n",
      "as he was getting into the train on his way to see Aglaya. He had had a\n",
      "strong impulse to rush up to Rogojin, and repeat his words of the\n",
      "morning âWhose eyes are they?â Instead he had fled from the station,\n",
      "and knew nothing more, until he found himself gazing into the window of\n",
      "a cutlerâs shop, and wondering if a knife with a staghorn handle would\n",
      "cost more than sixty copecks. And as the prince sat dreaming in the\n",
      "Summer Garden under a lime-tree, a wicked demon had come and whispered\n",
      "in his car: âRogojin has been spying upon you and watching you all the\n",
      "morning in a frenzy of desperation. When he finds you have not gone to\n",
      "Pavlofskâa terrible discovery for himâhe will surely go at once to that\n",
      "house in Petersburg Side, and watch for you there, although only this\n",
      "morning you gave your word of honour not to see _her_, and swore that\n",
      "you had not come to Petersburg for that purpose.â And thereupon the\n",
      "prince had hastened off to that house, and what was there in the fact\n",
      "that he had met Rogojin there? He had only seen a wretched, suffering\n",
      "creature, whose state of mind was gloomy and miserable, but most\n",
      "comprehensible. In the morning Rogojin had seemed to be trying to keep\n",
      "out of the way; but at the station this afternoon he had stood out, he\n",
      "had concealed himself, indeed, less than the prince himself; at the\n",
      "house, now, he had stood fifty yards off on the other side of the road,\n",
      "with folded hands, watching, plainly in view and apparently desirous of\n",
      "being seen. He had stood there like an accuser, like a judge, not like\n",
      "aâa what?\n",
      "\n",
      "And why had not the prince approached him and spoken to him, instead of\n",
      "turning away and pretending he had seen nothing, although their eyes\n",
      "met? (Yes, their eyes had met, and they had looked at each other.) Why,\n",
      "he had himself wished to take Rogojin by the hand and go in together,\n",
      "he had himself determined to go to him on the morrow and tell him that\n",
      "he had seen her, he had repudiated the demon as he walked to the house,\n",
      "and his heart had been full of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was there something in the whole aspect of the man, today, sufficient\n",
      "to justify the princeâs terror, and the awful suspicions of his demon?\n",
      "Something seen, but indescribable, which filled him with dreadful\n",
      "presentiments? Yes, he was convinced of itâconvinced of what? (Oh, how\n",
      "mean and hideous of him to feel this conviction, this presentiment! How\n",
      "he blamed himself for it!) âSpeak if you dare, and tell me, what is the\n",
      "presentiment?â he repeated to himself, over and over again. âPut it\n",
      "into words, speak out clearly and distinctly. Oh, miserable coward that\n",
      "I am!â The prince flushed with shame for his own baseness. âHow shall I\n",
      "ever look this man in the face again? My God, what a day! And what a\n",
      "nightmare, what a nightmare!â\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a moment, during this long, wretched walk back from the\n",
      "Petersburg Side, when the prince felt an irresistible desire to go\n",
      "straight to Rogojinâs, wait for him, embrace him with tears of shame\n",
      "and contrition, and tell him of his distrust, and finish with itâonce\n",
      "for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here he was back at his hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "How often during the day he had thought of this hotel with loathingâits\n",
      "corridor, its rooms, its stairs. How he had dreaded coming back to it,\n",
      "for some reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat a regular old woman I am today,â he had said to himself each\n",
      "time, with annoyance. âI believe in every foolish presentiment that\n",
      "comes into my head.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped for a moment at the door; a great flush of shame came over\n",
      "him. âI am a coward, a wretched coward,â he said, and moved forward\n",
      "again; but once more he paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among all the incidents of the day, one recurred to his mind to the\n",
      "exclusion of the rest; although now that his self-control was regained,\n",
      "and he was no longer under the influence of a nightmare, he was able to\n",
      "think of it calmly. It concerned the knife on Rogojinâs table. âWhy\n",
      "should not Rogojin have as many knives on his table as he chooses?â\n",
      "thought the prince, wondering at his suspicions, as he had done when he\n",
      "found himself looking into the cutlerâs window. âWhat could it have to\n",
      "do with me?â he said to himself again, and stopped as if rooted to the\n",
      "ground by a kind of paralysis of limb such as attacks people under the\n",
      "stress of some humiliating recollection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doorway was dark and gloomy at any time; but just at this moment it\n",
      "was rendered doubly so by the fact that the thunder-storm had just\n",
      "broken, and the rain was coming down in torrents.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the semi-darkness the prince distinguished a man standing close\n",
      "to the stairs, apparently waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing particularly significant in the fact that a man was\n",
      "standing back in the doorway, waiting to come out or go upstairs; but\n",
      "the prince felt an irresistible conviction that he knew this man, and\n",
      "that it was Rogojin. The man moved on up the stairs; a moment later the\n",
      "prince passed up them, too. His heart froze within him. âIn a minute or\n",
      "two I shall know all,â he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staircase led to the first and second corridors of the hotel, along\n",
      "which lay the guestsâ bedrooms. As is often the case in Petersburg\n",
      "houses, it was narrow and very dark, and turned around a massive stone\n",
      "column.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the\n",
      "stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about half a yard\n",
      "wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood\n",
      "concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there. He\n",
      "would pass by quickly and not look. He took a step forward, but could\n",
      "bear the uncertainty no longer and turned his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eyesâthe same two eyesâmet his! The man concealed in the niche had\n",
      "also taken a step forward. For one second they stood face to face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the prince caught the man by the shoulder and twisted him\n",
      "round towards the light, so that he might see his face more clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojinâs eyes flashed, and a smile of insanity distorted his\n",
      "countenance. His right hand was raised, and something glittered in it.\n",
      "The prince did not think of trying to stop it. All he could remember\n",
      "afterwards was that he seemed to have called out:\n",
      "\n",
      "âParfen! I wonât believe it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Next moment something appeared to burst open before him: a wonderful\n",
      "inner light illuminated his soul. This lasted perhaps half a second,\n",
      "yet he distinctly remembered hearing the beginning of the wail, the\n",
      "strange, dreadful wail, which burst from his lips of its own accord,\n",
      "and which no effort of will on his part could suppress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next moment he was absolutely unconscious; black darkness blotted out\n",
      "everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had fallen in an epileptic fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "As is well known, these fits occur instantaneously. The face,\n",
      "especially the eyes, become terribly disfigured, convulsions seize the\n",
      "limbs, a terrible cry breaks from the sufferer, a wail from which\n",
      "everything human seems to be blotted out, so that it is impossible to\n",
      "believe that the man who has just fallen is the same who emitted the\n",
      "dreadful cry. It seems more as though some other being, inside the\n",
      "stricken one, had cried. Many people have borne witness to this\n",
      "impression; and many cannot behold an epileptic fit without a feeling\n",
      "of mysterious terror and dread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a feeling, we must suppose, overtook Rogojin at this moment, and\n",
      "saved the princeâs life. Not knowing that it was a fit, and seeing his\n",
      "victim disappear head foremost into the darkness, hearing his head\n",
      "strike the stone steps below with a crash, Rogojin rushed downstairs,\n",
      "skirting the body, and flung himself headlong out of the hotel, like a\n",
      "raving madman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The princeâs body slipped convulsively down the steps till it rested at\n",
      "the bottom. Very soon, in five minutes or so, he was discovered, and a\n",
      "crowd collected around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pool of blood on the steps near his head gave rise to grave fears.\n",
      "Was it a case of accident, or had there been a crime? It was, however,\n",
      "soon recognized as a case of epilepsy, and identification and proper\n",
      "measures for restoration followed one another, owing to a fortunate\n",
      "circumstance. Colia Ivolgin had come back to his hotel about seven\n",
      "oâclock, owing to a sudden impulse which made him refuse to dine at the\n",
      "Epanchinsâ, and, finding a note from the prince awaiting him, had sped\n",
      "away to the latterâs address. Arrived there, he ordered a cup of tea\n",
      "and sat sipping it in the coffee-room. While there he heard excited\n",
      "whispers of someone just found at the bottom of the stairs in a fit;\n",
      "upon which he had hurried to the spot, with a presentiment of evil, and\n",
      "at once recognized the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sufferer was immediately taken to his room, and though he partially\n",
      "regained consciousness, he lay long in a semi-dazed condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor stated that there was no danger to be apprehended from the\n",
      "wound on the head, and as soon as the prince could understand what was\n",
      "going on around him, Colia hired a carriage and took him away to\n",
      "Lebedeffâs. There he was received with much cordiality, and the\n",
      "departure to the country was hastened on his account. Three days later\n",
      "they were all at Pavlofsk.\n",
      "\n",
      "VI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeffâs country-house was not large, but it was pretty and\n",
      "convenient, especially the part which was let to the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "A row of orange and lemon trees and jasmines, planted in green tubs,\n",
      "stood on the fairly wide terrace. According to Lebedeff, these trees\n",
      "gave the house a most delightful aspect. Some were there when he bought\n",
      "it, and he was so charmed with the effect that he promptly added to\n",
      "their number. When the tubs containing these plants arrived at the\n",
      "villa and were set in their places, Lebedeff kept running into the\n",
      "street to enjoy the view of the house, and every time he did so the\n",
      "rent to be demanded from the future tenant went up with a bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "This country villa pleased the prince very much in his state of\n",
      "physical and mental exhaustion. On the day that they left for Pavlofsk,\n",
      "that is the day after his attack, he appeared almost well, though in\n",
      "reality he felt very far from it. The faces of those around him for the\n",
      "last three days had made a pleasant impression. He was pleased to see,\n",
      "not only Colia, who had become his inseparable companion, but Lebedeff\n",
      "himself and all the family, except the nephew, who had left the house.\n",
      "He was also glad to receive a visit from General Ivolgin, before\n",
      "leaving St. Petersburg.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was getting late when the party arrived at Pavlofsk, but several\n",
      "people called to see the prince, and assembled in the verandah. Gania\n",
      "was the first to arrive. He had grown so pale and thin that the prince\n",
      "could hardly recognize him. Then came Varia and Ptitsin, who were\n",
      "rusticating in the neighbourhood. As to General Ivolgin, he scarcely\n",
      "budged from Lebedeffâs house, and seemed to have moved to Pavlofsk with\n",
      "him. Lebedeff did his best to keep Ardalion Alexandrovitch by him, and\n",
      "to prevent him from invading the princeâs quarters. He chatted with him\n",
      "confidentially, so that they might have been taken for old friends.\n",
      "During those three days the prince had noticed that they frequently\n",
      "held long conversations; he often heard their voices raised in argument\n",
      "on deep and learned subjects, which evidently pleased Lebedeff. He\n",
      "seemed as if he could not do without the general. But it was not only\n",
      "Ardalion Alexandrovitch whom Lebedeff kept out of the princeâs way.\n",
      "Since they had come to the villa, he treated his own family the same.\n",
      "Upon the pretext that his tenant needed quiet, he kept him almost in\n",
      "isolation, and Muishkin protested in vain against this excess of zeal.\n",
      "Lebedeff stamped his feet at his daughters and drove them away if they\n",
      "attempted to join the prince on the terrace; not even Vera was\n",
      "excepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThey will lose all respect if they are allowed to be so free and easy;\n",
      "besides it is not proper for them,â he declared at last, in answer to a\n",
      "direct question from the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy on earth not?â asked the latter. âReally, you know, you are making\n",
      "yourself a nuisance, by keeping guard over me like this. I get bored\n",
      "all by myself; I have told you so over and over again, and you get on\n",
      "my nerves more than ever by waving your hands and creeping in and out\n",
      "in the mysterious way you do.â\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fact that Lebedeff, though he was so anxious to keep everyone\n",
      "else from disturbing the patient, was continually in and out of the\n",
      "princeâs room himself. He invariably began by opening the door a crack\n",
      "and peering in to see if the prince was there, or if he had escaped;\n",
      "then he would creep softly up to the arm-chair, sometimes making\n",
      "Muishkin jump by his sudden appearance. He always asked if the patient\n",
      "wanted anything, and when the latter replied that he only wanted to be\n",
      "left in peace, he would turn away obediently and make for the door on\n",
      "tip-toe, with deprecatory gestures to imply that he had only just\n",
      "looked in, that he would not speak a word, and would go away and not\n",
      "intrude again; which did not prevent him from reappearing in ten\n",
      "minutes or a quarter of an hour. Colia had free access to the prince,\n",
      "at which Lebedeff was quite disgusted and indignant. He would listen at\n",
      "the door for half an hour at a time while the two were talking. Colia\n",
      "found this out, and naturally told the prince of his discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you think yourself my master, that you try to keep me under lock\n",
      "and key like this?â said the prince to Lebedeff. âIn the country, at\n",
      "least, I intend to be free, and you may make up your mind that I mean\n",
      "to see whom I like, and go where I please.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, of course,â replied the clerk, gesticulating with his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince looked him sternly up and down.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, Lukian Timofeyovitch, have you brought the little cupboard that\n",
      "you had at the head of your bed with you here?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, I left it where it was.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âImpossible!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt cannot be moved; you would have to pull the wall down, it is so\n",
      "firmly fixed.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âPerhaps you have one like it here?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have one that is even better, much better; that is really why I\n",
      "bought this house.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh! What visitor did you turn away from my door, about an hour ago?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe-the general. I would not let him in; there is no need for him to\n",
      "visit you, prince... I have the deepest esteem for him, he is aâa great\n",
      "man. You donât believe it? Well, you will see, and yet, most excellent\n",
      "prince, you had much better not receive him.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMay I ask why? and also why you walk about on tiptoe and always seem\n",
      "as if you were going to whisper a secret in my ear whenever you come\n",
      "near me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am vile, vile; I know it!â cried Lebedeff, beating his breast with a\n",
      "contrite air. âBut will not the general be too hospitable for you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âToo hospitable?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes. First, he proposes to come and live in my house. Well and good;\n",
      "but he sticks at nothing; he immediately makes himself one of the\n",
      "family. We have talked over our respective relations several times, and\n",
      "discovered that we are connected by marriage. It seems also that you\n",
      "are a sort of nephew on his motherâs side; he was explaining it to me\n",
      "again only yesterday. If you are his nephew, it follows that I must\n",
      "also be a relation of yours, most excellent prince. Never mind about\n",
      "that, it is only a foible; but just now he assured me that all his\n",

      "has entertained at least two hundred guests at his table every day.\n",
      "Finally, he went so far as to say that they never rose from the table;\n",
      "they dined, supped, and had tea, for fifteen hours at a stretch. This\n",
      "went on for thirty years without a break; there was barely time to\n",
      "change the table-cloth; directly one person left, another took his\n",
      "place. On feast-days he entertained as many as three hundred guests,\n",
      "and they numbered seven hundred on the thousandth anniversary of the\n",
      "foundation of the Russian Empire. It amounts to a passion with him; it\n",
      "makes one uneasy to hear of it. It is terrible to have to entertain\n",
      "people who do things on such a scale. That is why I wonder whether such\n",
      "a man is not too hospitable for you and me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut you seem to be on the best of terms with him?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âQuite fraternalâI look upon it as a joke. Let us be brothers-in-law,\n",
      "it is all the same to me,ârather an honour than not. But in spite of\n",
      "the two hundred guests and the thousandth anniversary of the Russian\n",
      "Empire, I can see that he is a very remarkable man. I am quite sincere.\n",
      "You said just now that I always looked as if I was going to tell you a\n",
      "secret; you are right. I have a secret to tell you: a certain person\n",
      "has just let me know that she is very anxious for a secret interview\n",
      "with you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy should it be secret? Not at all; I will call on her myself\n",
      "tomorrow.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, oh no!â cried Lebedeff, waving his arms; âif she is afraid, it is\n",
      "not for the reason you think. By the way, do you know that the monster\n",
      "comes every day to inquire after your health?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou call him a monster so often that it makes me suspicious.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou must have no suspicions, none whatever,â said Lebedeff quickly. âI\n",
      "only want you to know that the person in question is not afraid of him,\n",
      "but of something quite, quite different.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat on earth is she afraid of, then? Tell me plainly, without any\n",
      "more beating about the bush,â said the prince, exasperated by the\n",
      "otherâs mysterious grimaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh that is the secret,â said Lebedeff, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhose secret?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYours. You forbade me yourself to mention it before you, most\n",
      "excellent prince,â murmured Lebedeff. Then, satisfied that he had\n",
      "worked up Muishkinâs curiosity to the highest pitch, he added abruptly:\n",
      "âShe is afraid of Aglaya Ivanovna.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince frowned for a moment in silence, and then said suddenly:\n",
      "\n",
      "âReally, Lebedeff, I must leave your house. Where are Gavrila\n",
      "Ardalionovitch and the Ptitsins? Are they here? Have you chased them\n",
      "away, too?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThey are coming, they are coming; and the general as well. I will open\n",
      "all the doors; I will call all my daughters, all of them, this very\n",
      "minute,â said Lebedeff in a low voice, thoroughly frightened, and\n",
      "waving his hands as he ran from door to door.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment Colia appeared on the terrace; he announced that\n",
      "Lizabetha Prokofievna and her three daughters were close behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moved by this news, Lebedeff hurried up to the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âShall I call the Ptitsins, and Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Shall I let the\n",
      "general in?â he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy not? Let in anyone who wants to see me. I assure you, Lebedeff,\n",
      "you have misunderstood my position from the very first; you have been\n",
      "wrong all along. I have not the slightest reason to hide myself from\n",
      "anyone,â replied the prince gaily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing him laugh, Lebedeff thought fit to laugh also, and though much\n",
      "agitated his satisfaction was quite visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colia was right; the Epanchin ladies were only a few steps behind him.\n",
      "As they approached the terrace other visitors appeared from Lebedeffâs\n",
      "side of the houseâthe Ptitsins, Gania, and Ardalion Alexandrovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Epanchins had only just heard of the princeâs illness and of his\n",
      "presence in Pavlofsk, from Colia; and up to this time had been in a\n",
      "state of considerable bewilderment about him. The general brought the\n",
      "princeâs card down from town, and Mrs. Epanchin had felt convinced that\n",
      "he himself would follow his card at once; she was much excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain the girls assured her that a man who had not written for six\n",
      "months would not be in such a dreadful hurry, and that probably he had\n",
      "enough to do in town without needing to bustle down to Pavlofsk to see\n",
      "them. Their mother was quite angry at the very idea of such a thing,\n",
      "and announced her absolute conviction that he would turn up the next\n",
      "day at latest.\n",
      "\n",
      "So next day the prince was expected all the morning, and at dinner,\n",
      "tea, and supper; and when he did not appear in the evening, Mrs.\n",
      "Epanchin quarrelled with everyone in the house, finding plenty of\n",
      "pretexts without so much as mentioning the princeâs name.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day there was no talk of him at all, until Aglaya remarked\n",
      "at dinner: âMamma is cross because the prince hasnât turned up,â to\n",
      "which the general replied that it was not his fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin misunderstood the observation, and rising from her place\n",
      "she left the room in majestic wrath. In the evening, however, Colia\n",
      "came with the story of the princeâs adventures, so far as he knew them.\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin was triumphant; although Colia had to listen to a long\n",
      "lecture. âHe idles about here the whole day long, one canât get rid of\n",
      "him; and then when he is wanted he does not come. He might have sent a\n",
      "line if he did not wish to inconvenience himself.â\n",
      "\n",
      "At the words âone canât get rid of him,â Colia was very angry, and\n",
      "nearly flew into a rage; but he resolved to be quiet for the time and\n",
      "show his resentment later. If the words had been less offensive he\n",
      "might have forgiven them, so pleased was he to see Lizabetha\n",
      "Prokofievna worried and anxious about the princeâs illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would have insisted on sending to Petersburg at once, for a certain\n",
      "great medical celebrity; but her daughters dissuaded her, though they\n",
      "were not willing to stay behind when she at once prepared to go and\n",
      "visit the invalid. Aglaya, however, suggested that it was a little\n",
      "unceremonious to go _en masse_ to see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âVery well then, stay at home,â said Mrs. Epanchin, âand a good thing\n",
      "too, for Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming down and there will be no one at\n",
      "home to receive him.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, after this, Aglaya went with the rest. In fact, she had\n",
      "never had the slightest intention of doing otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince S., who was in the house, was requested to escort the ladies. He\n",
      "had been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the\n",
      "Epanchins. It appeared that they had known one another before, and had\n",
      "spent some time together in a little provincial town three months ago.\n",
      "Prince S. had greatly taken to him, and was delighted with the\n",
      "opportunity of meeting him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general had not come down from town as yet, nor had Evgenie\n",
      "Pavlovitch arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not more than two or three hundred yards from the Epanchinsâ\n",
      "house to Lebedeffâs. The first disagreeable impression experienced by\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin was to find the prince surrounded by a whole assembly of\n",
      "other guestsânot to mention the fact that some of those present were\n",
      "particularly detestable in her eyes. The next annoying circumstance was\n",
      "when an apparently strong and healthy young fellow, well dressed, and\n",
      "smiling, came forward to meet her on the terrace, instead of the\n",
      "half-dying unfortunate whom she had expected to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was astonished and vexed, and her disappointment pleased Colia\n",
      "immensely. Of course he could have undeceived her before she started,\n",
      "but the mischievous boy had been careful not to do that, foreseeing the\n",
      "probably laughable disgust that she would experience when she found her\n",
      "dear friend, the prince, in good health. Colia was indelicate enough to\n",
      "voice the delight he felt at his success in managing to annoy Lizabetha\n",
      "Prokofievna, with whom, in spite of their really amicable relations, he\n",
      "was constantly sparring.\n",
      "\n",
      "âJust wait a while, my boy!â said she; âdonât be too certain of your\n",
      "triumph.â And she sat down heavily, in the arm-chair pushed forward by\n",
      "the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff, Ptitsin, and General Ivolgin hastened to find chairs for the\n",
      "young ladies. Varia greeted them joyfully, and they exchanged\n",
      "confidences in ecstatic whispers.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI must admit, prince, I was a little put out to see you up and about\n",
      "like thisâI expected to find you in bed; but I give you my word, I was\n",
      "only annoyed for an instant, before I collected my thoughts properly. I\n",
      "am always wiser on second thoughts, and I dare say you are the same. I\n",
      "assure you I am as glad to see you well as though you were my own\n",
      "son,âyes, and more; and if you donât believe me the more shame to you,\n",
      "and itâs not my fault. But that spiteful boy delights in playing all\n",
      "sorts of tricks. You are his patron, it seems. Well, I warn you that\n",
      "one fine morning I shall deprive myself of the pleasure of his further\n",
      "acquaintance.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat have I done wrong now?â cried Colia. âWhat was the good of\n",
      "telling you that the prince was nearly well again? You would not have\n",
      "believed me; it was so much more interesting to picture him on his\n",
      "death-bed.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow long do you remain here, prince?â asked Madame Epanchin.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAll the summer, and perhaps longer.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are alone, arenât you,ânot married?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, Iâm not married!â replied the prince, smiling at the ingenuousness\n",
      "of this little feeler.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, you neednât laugh! These things do happen, you know! Now thenâwhy\n",
      "didnât you come to us? We have a wing quite empty. But just as you\n",
      "like, of course. Do you lease it from _him?_âthis fellow, I mean,â she\n",
      "added, nodding towards Lebedeff. âAnd why does he always wriggle so?â\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment Vera, carrying the baby in her arms as usual, came out\n",
      "of the house, on to the terrace. Lebedeff kept fidgeting among the\n",
      "chairs, and did not seem to know what to do with himself, though he had\n",
      "no intention of going away. He no sooner caught sight of his daughter,\n",
      "than he rushed in her direction, waving his arms to keep her away; he\n",
      "even forgot himself so far as to stamp his foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs he mad?â asked Madame Epanchin suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, he...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âPerhaps he is drunk? Your company is rather peculiar,â she added, with\n",
      "a glance at the other guests....\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut what a pretty girl! Who is she?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat is Lebedeffâs daughterâVera Lukianovna.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIndeed? She looks very sweet. I should like to make her acquaintance.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The words were hardly out of her mouth, when Lebedeff dragged Vera\n",
      "forward, in order to present her.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOrphans, poor orphans!â he began in a pathetic voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe child she carries is an orphan, too. She is Veraâs sister, my\n",
      "daughter Luboff. The day this babe was born, six weeks ago, my wife\n",
      "died, by the will of God Almighty.... Yes... Vera takes her motherâs\n",
      "place, though she is but her sister... nothing more... nothing more...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd you! You are nothing more than a fool, if youâll excuse me! Well!\n",
      "well! you know that yourself, I expect,â said the lady indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff bowed low. âIt is the truth,â he replied, with extreme\n",
      "respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, Mr. Lebedeff, I am told you lecture on the Apocalypse. Is it\n",
      "true?â asked Aglaya.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, that is so... for the last fifteen years.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have heard of you, and I think read of you in the newspapers.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, that was another commentator, whom the papers named. He is dead,\n",
      "however, and I have taken his place,â said the other, much delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWe are neighbours, so will you be so kind as to come over one day and\n",
      "explain the Apocalypse to me?â said Aglaya. âI do not understand it in\n",
      "the least.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAllow me to warn you,â interposed General Ivolgin, âthat he is the\n",
      "greatest charlatan on earth.â He had taken the chair next to the girl,\n",
      "and was impatient to begin talking. âNo doubt there are pleasures and\n",
      "amusements peculiar to the country,â he continued, âand to listen to a\n",
      "pretended student holding forth on the book of the Revelations may be\n",
      "as good as any other. It may even be original. But... you seem to be\n",
      "looking at me with some surpriseâmay I introduce myselfâGeneral\n",
      "IvolginâI carried you in my arms as a babyââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âDelighted, Iâm sure,â said Aglaya; âI am acquainted with Varvara\n",
      "Ardalionovna and Nina Alexandrovna.â She was trying hard to restrain\n",
      "herself from laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin flushed up; some accumulation of spleen in her suddenly\n",
      "needed an outlet. She could not bear this General Ivolgin whom she had\n",
      "once known, long agoâin society.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are deviating from the truth, sir, as usual!â she remarked,\n",
      "boiling over with indignation; âyou never carried her in your life!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou have forgotten, mother,â said Aglaya, suddenly. âHe really did\n",
      "carry me about,âin Tver, you know. I was six years old, I remember. He\n",
      "made me a bow and arrow, and I shot a pigeon. Donât you remember\n",
      "shooting a pigeon, you and I, one day?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, and he made me a cardboard helmet, and a little wooden swordâI\n",
      "remember!â said Adelaida.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, I remember too!â said Alexandra. âYou quarrelled about the\n",
      "wounded pigeon, and Adelaida was put in the corner, and stood there\n",
      "with her helmet and sword and all.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor general had merely made the remark about having carried Aglaya\n",
      "in his arms because he always did so begin a conversation with young\n",
      "people. But it happened that this time he had really hit upon the\n",
      "truth, though he had himself entirely forgotten the fact. But when\n",
      "Adelaida and Aglaya recalled the episode of the pigeon, his mind became\n",
      "filled with memories, and it is impossible to describe how this poor\n",
      "old man, usually half drunk, was moved by the recollection.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI rememberâI remember it all!â he cried. âI was captain then. You were\n",
      "such a lovely little thingâNina Alexandrovna!âGania, listen! I was\n",
      "received then by General Epanchin.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, and look what you have come to now!â interrupted Mrs. Epanchin.\n",
      "âHowever, I see you have not quite drunk your better feelings away. But\n",
      "youâve broken your wifeâs heart, sirâand instead of looking after your\n",
      "children, you have spent your time in public-houses and debtorsâ\n",
      "prisons! Go away, my friend, stand in some corner and weep, and bemoan\n",
      "your fallen dignity, and perhaps God will forgive you yet! Go, go! Iâm\n",
      "serious! Thereâs nothing so favourable for repentance as to think of\n",
      "the past with feelings of remorse!â\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no need to repeat that she was serious. The general, like all\n",
      "drunkards, was extremely emotional and easily touched by recollections\n",
      "of his better days. He rose and walked quietly to the door, so meekly\n",
      "that Mrs. Epanchin was instantly sorry for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âArdalion Alexandrovitch,â she cried after him, âwait a moment, we are\n",
      "all sinners! When you feel that your conscience reproaches you a little\n",
      "less, come over to me and weâll have a talk about the past! I dare say\n",
      "I am fifty times more of a sinner than you are! And now go, go,\n",
      "good-bye, you had better not stay here!â she added, in alarm, as he\n",
      "turned as though to come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDonât go after him just now, Colia, or heâll be vexed, and the benefit\n",
      "of this moment will be lost!â said the prince, as the boy was hurrying\n",
      "out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "âQuite true! Much better to go in half an hour or so,â said Mrs.\n",
      "Epanchin.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs what comes of telling the truth for once in oneâs life!â said\n",

      "The prince took the first opportunity of informing the Epanchin ladies\n",
      "that he had intended to pay them a visit that day, if they had not\n",
      "themselves come this afternoon, and Lizabetha Prokofievna replied that\n",

      "\n",
      "By this time some of the visitors had disappeared.\n",

      "his first meeting with the Epanchins since the rupture. Twice Mrs.\n",
      "Epanchin had deliberately examined him from head to foot; but he had\n",
      "stood fire without flinching. He was certainly much changed, as anyone\n",
      "could see who had not met him for some time; and this fact seemed to\n",
      "afford Aglaya a good deal of satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat was Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who just went out, wasnât it?â she\n",

      "remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, it was,â said the prince.\n",

      "whom you were referring to, of course, whether to Don Quixote, or\n",

      "\n",
      "âI donât know what you are driving at; what mask do you mean?â said\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin, irritably. She began to see pretty clearly though what\n",
      "it meant, and whom they referred to by the generally accepted title of\n",
      "âpoor knight.â But what specially annoyed her was that the prince was\n",
      "looking so uncomfortable, and blushing like a ten-year-old child.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, have you finished your silly joke?â she added, âand am I to be\n",

      "cannot be approached lightly?â\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âItâs simply that there is a Russian poem,â began Prince S., evidently\n",
      "anxious to change the conversation, âa strange thing, without beginning\n",
      "or end, and all about a âpoor knight.â A month or so ago, we were all\n",
      "talking and laughing, and looking up a subject for one of Adelaidaâs\n",
      "picturesâyou know it is the principal business of this family to find\n",
      "subjects for Adelaidaâs pictures. Well, we happened upon this âpoor\n",
      "knight.â I donât remember who thought of it firstââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh! Aglaya Ivanovna did,â said Colia.\n",

      "that, in order to make a picture of the gentleman, she must first see\n",
      "his face. We then began to think over all our friendsâ faces to see if\n",
      "any of them would do, and none suited us, and so the matter stood;\n",
      "thatâs all. I donât know why Nicolai Ardalionovitch has brought up the\n",
      "joke now. What was appropriate and funny then, has quite lost all\n",
      "interest by this time.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âProbably thereâs some new silliness about it,â said Mrs. Epanchin,\n",
      "sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere is no silliness about it at allâonly the profoundest respect,â\n",
      "said Aglaya, very seriously. She had quite recovered her temper; in\n",
      "fact, from certain signs, it was fair to conclude that she was\n",
      "delighted to see this joke going so far; and a careful observer might\n",
      "have remarked that her satisfaction dated from the moment when the fact\n",
      "of the princeâs confusion became apparent to all.\n",
      "\n",
      "ââProfoundest respect!â What nonsense! First, insane giggling, and\n",
      "then, all of a sudden, a display of âprofoundest respect.â Why respect?\n",
      "Tell me at once, why have you suddenly developed this âprofound\n",
      "respect,â eh?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBecause,â replied Aglaya gravely, âin the poem the knight is described\n",
      "as a man capable of living up to an ideal all his life. That sort of\n",
      "thing is not to be found every day among the men of our times. In the\n",
      "poem it is not stated exactly what the ideal was, but it was evidently\n",
      "some vision, some revelation of pure Beauty, and the knight wore round\n",
      "his neck, instead of a scarf, a rosary. A deviceâA. N. B.âthe meaning\n",
      "of which is not explained, was inscribed on his shieldââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, A. N. D.,â corrected Colia.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI say A. N. B., and so it shall be!â cried Aglaya, irritably. âAnyway,\n",
      "the âpoor knightâ did not care what his lady was, or what she did. He\n",
      "had chosen his ideal, and he was bound to serve her, and break lances\n",
      "for her, and acknowledge her as the ideal of pure Beauty, whatever she\n",
      "might say or do afterwards. If she had taken to stealing, he would have\n",
      "championed her just the same. I think the poet desired to embody in\n",
      "this one picture the whole spirit of medieval chivalry and the platonic\n",
      "love of a pure and high-souled knight. Of course itâs all an ideal, and\n",
      "in the âpoor knightâ that spirit reached the utmost limit of\n",
      "asceticism. He is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical. I used\n",
      "not to understand him, and laughed at him, but now I love the âpoor\n",
      "knight,â and respect his actions.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to\n",
      "judge whether she was joking or in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,â said\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin; âand as for you, young woman, you ought to know better.\n",
      "At all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it?\n",
      "Recite it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life.\n",
      "Prince, you must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort\n",
      "of thing! Be patient!â\n",
      "\n",
      "They certainly were put out, both of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could\n",
      "not get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her\n",
      "little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the\n",
      "least embarrassed. She seemed, in fact, quite pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "She now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the\n",
      "terrace, and stood in front of the princeâs chair. All looked on with\n",
      "some surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided\n",
      "alarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far\n",
      "enough already, they thought. But Aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed\n",
      "the affectation and ceremony with which she was introducing her\n",
      "recitation of the poem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin was just wondering whether she would not forbid the\n",
      "performance after all, when, at the very moment that Aglaya commenced\n",
      "her declamation, two new guests, both talking loudly, entered from the\n",
      "street. The new arrivals were General Epanchin and a young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their entrance caused some slight commotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "VII.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young fellow accompanying the general was about twenty-eight, tall,\n",
      "and well built, with a handsome and clever face, and bright black eyes,\n",
      "full of fun and intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aglaya did not so much as glance at the new arrivals, but went on with\n",
      "her recitation, gazing at the prince the while in an affected manner,\n",
      "and at him alone. It was clear to him that she was doing all this with\n",
      "some special object.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the new guests at least somewhat eased his strained and\n",
      "uncomfortable position. Seeing them approaching, he rose from his\n",
      "chair, and nodding amicably to the general, signed to him not to\n",
      "interrupt the recitation. He then got behind his chair, and stood there\n",
      "with his left hand resting on the back of it. Thanks to this change of\n",
      "position, he was able to listen to the ballad with far less\n",
      "embarrassment than before. Mrs. Epanchin had also twice motioned to the\n",
      "new arrivals to be quiet, and stay where they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was much interested in the young man who had just entered.\n",
      "He easily concluded that this was Evgenie Pavlovitch Radomski, of whom\n",
      "he had already heard mention several times. He was puzzled, however, by\n",
      "the young manâs plain clothes, for he had always heard of Evgenie\n",
      "Pavlovitch as a military man. An ironical smile played on Evgenieâs\n",
      "lips all the while the recitation was proceeding, which showed that he,\n",
      "too, was probably in the secret of the âpoor knightâ joke. But it had\n",
      "become quite a different matter with Aglaya. All the affectation of\n",
      "manner which she had displayed at the beginning disappeared as the\n",
      "ballad proceeded. She spoke the lines in so serious and exalted a\n",
      "manner, and with so much taste, that she even seemed to justify the\n",
      "exaggerated solemnity with which she had stepped forward. It was\n",
      "impossible to discern in her now anything but a deep feeling for the\n",
      "spirit of the poem which she had undertaken to interpret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eyes were aglow with inspiration, and a slight tremor of rapture\n",
      "passed over her lovely features once or twice. She continued to recite:\n",
      "\n",
      "âOnce there came a vision glorious,\n",
      "Mystic, dreadful, wondrous fair;\n",
      "Burned itself into his spirit,\n",
      "And abode for ever there!\n",
      "\n",
      "âNever moreâfrom that sweet momentâ\n",
      "GazÃ©d he on womankind;\n",
      "He was dumb to love and wooing\n",
      "And to all their graces blind.\n",
      "\n",
      "âFull of love for that sweet vision,\n",
      "Brave and pure he took the field;\n",
      "With his blood he stained the letters\n",
      "N. P. B. upon his shield.\n",
      "\n",
      "ââLumen caeli, sancta Rosa!â\n",
      "Shouting on the foe he fell,\n",
      "And like thunder rang his war-cry\n",
      "Oâer the cowering infidel.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen within his distant castle,\n",
      "Home returned, he dreamed his daysâ\n",
      "Silent, sad,âand when death took him\n",
      "He was mad, the legend says.â\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When recalling all this afterwards the prince could not for the life of\n",
      "him understand how to reconcile the beautiful, sincere, pure nature of\n",
      "the girl with the irony of this jest. That it was a jest there was no\n",
      "doubt whatever; he knew that well enough, and had good reason, too, for\n",
      "his conviction; for during her recitation of the ballad Aglaya had\n",
      "deliberately changed the letters A. N. B. into N. P. B. He was quite\n",
      "sure she had not done this by accident, and that his ears had not\n",
      "deceived him. At all events her performanceâwhich was a joke, of\n",
      "course, if rather a crude one,âwas premeditated. They had evidently\n",
      "talked (and laughed) over the âpoor knightâ for more than a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Aglaya had brought out these letters N. P. B. not only without the\n",
      "slightest appearance of irony, or even any particular accentuation, but\n",
      "with so even and unbroken an appearance of seriousness that assuredly\n",
      "anyone might have supposed that these initials were the original ones\n",
      "written in the ballad. The thing made an uncomfortable impression upon\n",
      "the prince. Of course Mrs. Epanchin saw nothing either in the change of\n",
      "initials or in the insinuation embodied therein. General Epanchin only\n",
      "knew that there was a recitation of verses going on, and took no\n",
      "further interest in the matter. Of the rest of the audience, many had\n",
      "understood the allusion and wondered both at the daring of the lady and\n",
      "at the motive underlying it, but tried to show no sign of their\n",
      "feelings. But Evgenie Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager)\n",
      "both comprehended and tried his best to show that he comprehended; his\n",
      "smile was too mocking to leave any doubt on that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow beautiful that is!â cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration.\n",
      "âWhose is it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âPushkinâs, mama, of course! Donât disgrace us all by showing your\n",
      "ignorance,â said Adelaida.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAs soon as we reach home give it to me to read.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying\n",
      "about from time immemorial,â added Alexandra.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSend Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy,\n",
      "then.âAglaya, come hereâkiss me, dear, you recited beautifully! but,â\n",
      "she added in a whisper, âif you were sincere I am sorry for you. If it\n",
      "was a joke, I do not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do\n",
      "it, and in any case you would have done far better not to recite it at\n",
      "all. Do you understand?âNow come along, young woman; weâve sat here too\n",
      "long. Iâll speak to you about this another time.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the prince took the opportunity of greeting General Epanchin,\n",
      "and the general introduced Evgenie Pavlovitch to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI caught him up on the way to your house,â explained the general. âHe\n",
      "had heard that we were all here.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, and I heard that you were here, too,â added Evgenie Pavlovitch;\n",
      "âand since I had long promised myself the pleasure of seeking not only\n",
      "your acquaintance but your friendship, I did not wish to waste time,\n",
      "but came straight on. I am sorry to hear that you are unwell.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, but Iâm quite well now, thank you, and very glad to make your\n",
      "acquaintance. Prince S. has often spoken to me about you,â said\n",
      "Muishkin, and for an instant the two men looked intently into one\n",
      "anotherâs eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince remarked that Evgenie Pavlovitchâs plain clothes had\n",
      "evidently made a great impression upon the company present, so much so\n",
      "that all other interests seemed to be effaced before this surprising\n",
      "fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "His change of dress was evidently a matter of some importance. Adelaida\n",
      "and Alexandra poured out a stream of questions; Prince S., a relative\n",
      "of the young man, appeared annoyed; and Ivan Fedorovitch quite excited.\n",
      "Aglaya alone was not interested. She merely looked closely at Evgenie\n",
      "for a minute, curious perhaps as to whether civil or military clothes\n",
      "became him best, then turned away and paid no more attention to him or\n",
      "his costume. Lizabetha Prokofievna asked no questions, but it was clear\n",
      "that she was uneasy, and the prince fancied that Evgenie was not in her\n",
      "good graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe has astonished me,â said Ivan Fedorovitch. âI nearly fell down with\n",
      "surprise. I could hardly believe my eyes when I met him in Petersburg\n",
      "just now. Why this haste? Thatâs what I want to know. He has always\n",
      "said himself that there is no need to break windows.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitch remarked here that he had spoken of his intention of\n",
      "leaving the service long ago. He had, however, always made more or less\n",
      "of a joke about it, so no one had taken him seriously. For that matter\n",
      "he joked about everything, and his friends never knew what to believe,\n",
      "especially if he did not wish them to understand him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have only retired for a time,â said he, laughing. âFor a few months;\n",
      "at most for a year.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut there is no necessity for you to retire at all,â complained the\n",

      "\n",
      "After a few more expostulations, the conversation drifted into other\n",
      "channels, but the prince, who had been an attentive listener, thought\n",
      "all this excitement about so small a matter very curious. âThere must\n",
      "be more in it than appears,â he said to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI see the âpoor knightâ has come on the scene again,â said Evgenie\n",

      "\n",
      "To the amazement of the prince, who overheard the remark, Aglaya looked\n",
      "haughtily and inquiringly at the questioner, as though she would give\n",
      "him to know, once for all, that there could be no talk between them\n",

      "nothing intimidates them. Educated men, learned men even, are to be\n",

      "Nihilismâthough they are only known indirectly, and by hearsay, for\n",
      "they never advertise their doings in the papers. They go straight to\n",
      "the point. For them, it is not a question of showing that Pushkin is\n",
      "stupid, or that Russia must be torn in pieces. No; but if they have a\n",
      "great desire for anything, they believe they have a right to get it\n",
      "even at the cost of the lives, say, of eight persons. They are checked\n",
      "by no obstacles. In fact, prince, I should not advise you...â\n",
      "\n",

      "reproached himself bitterly for such a thought, and felt as if he\n",
      "should die of shame if it were discovered. When his new visitors\n",

      "respected than any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four persons entered, led by General Ivolgin, in a state of great\n",
      "excitement, and talking eloquently.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe is for me, undoubtedly!â thought the prince, with a smile. Colia\n",

      "who listened with a jeering smile on his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince begged the visitors to sit down. They were all so young that\n",
      "it made the proceedings seem even more extraordinary. Ivan Fedorovitch,\n",
      "who really understood nothing of what was going on, felt indignant at\n",
      "the sight of these youths, and would have interfered in some way had it\n",
      "not been for the extreme interest shown by his wife in the affair. He\n",
      "therefore remained, partly through curiosity, partly through\n",
      "good-nature, hoping that his presence might be of some use. But the bow\n",
      "with which General Ivolgin greeted him irritated him anew; he frowned,\n",
      "and decided to be absolutely silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the rest, one was a man of thirty, the retired officer, now a\n",
      "boxer, who had been with Rogojin, and in his happier days had given\n",
      "fifteen roubles at a time to beggars. Evidently he had joined the\n",
      "others as a comrade to give them moral, and if necessary material,\n",
      "support. The man who had been spoken of as âPavlicheffâs son,â although\n",
      "he gave the name of Antip Burdovsky, was about twenty-two years of age,\n",
      "fair, thin and rather tall. He was remarkable for the poverty, not to\n",
      "say uncleanliness, of his personal appearance: the sleeves of his\n",
      "overcoat were greasy; his dirty waistcoat, buttoned up to his neck,\n",
      "showed not a trace of linen; a filthy black silk scarf, twisted till it\n",
      "resembled a cord, was round his neck, and his hands were unwashed. He\n",
      "looked round with an air of insolent effrontery. His face, covered with\n",
      "pimples, was neither thoughtful nor even contemptuous; it wore an\n",
      "expression of complacent satisfaction in demanding his rights and in\n",
      "being an aggrieved party. His voice trembled, and he spoke so fast, and\n",
      "with such stammerings, that he might have been taken for a foreigner,\n",
      "though the purest Russian blood ran in his veins. Lebedeffâs nephew,\n",
      "whom the reader has seen already, accompanied him, and also the youth\n",
      "named Hippolyte Terentieff. The latter was only seventeen or eighteen.\n",
      "He had an intelligent face, though it was usually irritated and fretful\n",
      "in expression. His skeleton-like figure, his ghastly complexion, the\n",
      "brightness of his eyes, and the red spots of colour on his cheeks,\n",
      "betrayed the victim of consumption to the most casual glance. He\n",
      "coughed persistently, and panted for breath; it looked as though he had\n",
      "but a few weeks more to live. He was nearly dead with fatigue, and\n",
      "fell, rather than sat, into a chair. The rest bowed as they came in;\n",
      "and being more or less abashed, put on an air of extreme\n",
      "self-assurance. In short, their attitude was not that which one would\n",
      "have expected in men who professed to despise all trivialities, all\n",
      "foolish mundane conventions, and indeed everything, except their own\n",
      "personal interests.\n",

      "their caps. All appeared ready to speak, and yet all were silent; the\n",
      "defiant expression on their faces seemed to say, âNo, sir, you donât\n",

      "\n",
      "âI _did_ not expect you, gentlemen,â began the prince. âI have been ill\n",

      "\n",
      "âIt was a princely action!â sneered Hippolyte.\n",

      "\n",
      "This beginning gave promise of a stormy discussion. The prince was much\n",

      "his simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot\n",
      "stand alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this\n",

      "money, in memory of my benefactor, but I shall honour his memory quite\n",
      "as well by giving the ten thousand roubles to Mr. Burdovsky, because,\n",
      "though he was not Pavlicheffâs son, he was treated almost as though he\n",
      "were. That is what gave a rogue the opportunity of deceiving him; he\n",
      "really did think himself Pavlicheffâs son. Listen, gentlemen; this\n",
      "matter must be settled; keep calm; do not get angry; and sit down!\n",
      "Gavrila Ardalionovitch will explain everything to you at once, and I\n",

      "driven beyond the limits of endurance, he would not have ventured to\n",
      "express certain conjectures so openly. He had no sooner sat down than\n",
      "his heart was torn by sharp remorse. Besides insulting Burdovsky with\n",
      "the supposition, made in the presence of witnesses, that he was\n",

      "for all....â A movement of impatience was noticed in his audience as he\n",
      "resumed: âI merely wish to state, for the information of all concerned,\n",
      "that the reason for Mr. Pavlicheffâs interest in your mother, Mr.\n",
      "Burdovsky, was simply that she was the sister of a serf-girl with whom\n",
      "he was deeply in love in his youth, and whom most certainly he would\n",
      "have married but for her sudden death. I have proofs that this\n",
      "circumstance is almost, if not quite, forgotten. I may add that when\n",
      "your mother was about ten years old, Pavlicheff took her under his\n",
      "care, gave her a good education, and later, a considerable dowry. His\n",
      "relations were alarmed, and feared he might go so far as to marry her,\n",
      "but she gave her hand to a young land-surveyor named Burdovsky when she\n",
      "reached the age of twenty. I can even say definitely that it was a\n",
      "marriage of affection. After his wedding your father gave up his\n",
      "occupation as land-surveyor, and with his wifeâs dowry of fifteen\n",
      "thousand roubles went in for commercial speculations. As he had had no\n",
      "experience, he was cheated on all sides, and took to drink in order to\n",
      "forget his troubles. He shortened his life by his excesses, and eight\n",
      "years after his marriage he died. Your mother says herself that she was\n",
      "left in the direst poverty, and would have died of starvation had it\n",
      "not been for Pavlicheff, who generously allowed her a yearly pension of\n",
      "six hundred roubles. Many people recall his extreme fondness for you as\n",
      "a little boy. Your mother confirms this, and agrees with others in\n",
      "thinking that he loved you the more because you were a sickly child,\n",
      "stammering in your speech, and almost deformedâfor it is known that all\n",
      "his life Nicolai Andreevitch had a partiality for unfortunates of every\n",
      "kind, especially children. In my opinion this is most important. I may\n",
      "add that I discovered yet another fact, the last on which I employed my\n",
      "detective powers. Seeing how fond Pavlicheff was of you,âit was thanks\n",
      "to him you went to school, and also had the advantage of special\n",
      "teachersâhis relations and servants grew to believe that you were his\n",
      "son, and that your father had been betrayed by his wife. I may point\n",
      "out that this idea was only accredited generally during the last years\n",
      "of Pavlicheffâs life, when his next-of-kin were trembling about the\n",
      "succession, when the earlier story was quite forgotten, and when all\n",
      "opportunity for discovering the truth had seemingly passed away. No\n",
      "doubt you, Mr. Burdovsky, heard this conjecture, and did not hesitate\n",
      "to accept it as true. I have had the honour of making your motherâs\n",
      "acquaintance, and I find that she knows all about these reports. What\n",
      "she does not know is that you, her son, should have listened to them so\n",
      "complaisantly. I found your respected mother at Pskoff, ill and in deep\n",
      "poverty, as she has been ever since the death of your benefactor. She\n",
      "told me with tears of gratitude how you had supported her; she expects\n",

      "is quite convinced that Mr. Pavlicheffâs love for him came simply from\n",
      "generosity of soul, and not from paternal duty. It was most necessary\n",
      "to impress this fact upon his mind, considering that he approved of the\n",
      "article written by Mr. Keller. I speak thus because I look on you, Mr.\n",
      "Burdovsky, as an honourable man. Secondly, it appears that there was no\n",
      "intention of cheating in this case, even on the part of Tchebaroff. I\n",
      "wish to say this quite plainly, because the prince hinted a while ago\n",
      "that I too thought it an attempt at robbery and extortion. On the\n",
      "contrary, everyone has been quite sincere in the matter, and although\n",
      "Tchebaroff may be somewhat of a rogue, in this business he has acted\n",
      "simply as any sharp lawyer would do under the circumstances. He looked\n",
      "at it as a case that might bring him in a lot of money, and he did not\n",
      "calculate badly; because on the one hand he speculated on the\n",
      "generosity of the prince, and his gratitude to the late Mr. Pavlicheff,\n",
      "and on the other to his chivalrous ideas as to the obligations of\n",
      "honour and conscience. As to Mr. Burdovsky, allowing for his\n",
      "principles, we may acknowledge that he engaged in the business with\n",
      "very little personal aim in view. At the instigation of Tchebaroff and\n",
      "his other friends, he decided to make the attempt in the service of\n",
      "truth, progress, and humanity. In short, the conclusion may be drawn\n",
      "that, in spite of all appearances, Mr. Burdovsky is a man of\n",
      "irreproachable character, and thus the prince can all the more readily\n",
      "offer him his friendship, and the assistance of which he spoke just\n",
      "now...â\n",

      "usual the prince reproached himself, and had expected punishment, but\n",
      "he was inwardly convinced that Lizabetha Prokofievna could not be\n",
      "seriously angry with him, and that she probably was more angry with\n",
      "herself. He was painfully surprised, therefore, when three days passed\n",
      "with no word from her. Other things also troubled and perplexed him,\n",
      "and one of these grew more important in his eyes as the days went by.\n",
      "He had begun to blame himself for two opposite tendenciesâon the one\n",

      "By the end of the third day the incident of the eccentric lady and\n",

      "this new âmonstrosity,â or was it... but he refrained from saying who\n",
      "else might be in fault. As for the letters N.P.B., he looked on that as\n",
      "a harmless joke, a mere childish piece of mischiefâso childish that he\n",

      "out for a walk, and called in âby accident,â and talked for almost the\n",
      "whole of the time they were with him about a certain most lovely tree\n",
      "in the park, which Adelaida had set her heart upon for a picture. This,\n",
      "and a little amiable conversation on Prince S.âs part, occupied the\n",
      "time, and not a word was said about last eveningâs episodes. At length\n",
      "Adelaida burst out laughing, apologized, and explained that they had\n",
      "come incognito; from which, and from the circumstance that they said\n",
      "nothing about the princeâs either walking back with them or coming to\n",
      "see them later on, the latter inferred that he was in Mrs. Epanchinâs\n",
      "black books. Adelaida mentioned a watercolour that she would much like\n",
      "to show him, and explained that she would either send it by Colia, or\n",
      "bring it herself the next dayâwhich to the prince seemed very\n",
      "suggestive.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, just as the visitors were on the point of\n",
      "departing, Prince S. seemed suddenly to recollect himself. âOh yes,\n",
      "by-the-by,â he said, âdo you happen to know, my dear Lef Nicolaievitch,\n",
      "who that lady was who called out to Evgenie Pavlovitch last night, from\n",

      "âBut what on earth did she mean? I assure you it is a real riddle to\n",

      "influence of sincere astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "âShe spoke of some bills of Evgenie Pavlovitchâs,â said the prince,\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, I heard that much, my dear fellow! But the thing is so impossibly\n",
      "absurd! A man of property like Evgenie to give IOUâs to a money-lender,\n",
      "and to be worried about them! It is ridiculous. Besides, he cannot\n",
      "possibly be on such intimate terms with Nastasia Philipovna as she gave\n",
      "us to understand; thatâs the principal part of the mystery! He has\n",
      "given me his word that he knows nothing whatever about the matter, and\n",
      "of course I believe him. Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you\n",
      "know anything about it? Has any sort of suspicion of the meaning of it\n",

      "\n",
      "âBut I ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common\n",

      "momentâs silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, that may be. He may have known her some time agoâtwo or three\n",
      "years, at least. He used to know Totski. But it is impossible that\n",
      "there should be any intimacy between them. She has not even been in the\n",
      "placeâmany people donât even know that she has returned from Moscow! I\n",

      "The visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than\n",
      "before. But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince,\n",
      "from his own point of view. Admitting that he had his suspicions, from\n",
      "the moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that\n",
      "Nastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his\n",
      "suspicions and justified his fears. It was all clear to him; Prince S.\n",
      "was wrong, perhaps, in his view of the matter, but he was somewhere\n",
      "near the truth, and was right in so far as that he understood there to\n",
      "be an intrigue of some sort going on. Perhaps Prince S. saw it all more\n",
      "clearly than he had allowed his hearers to understand. At all events,\n",
      "nothing could be plainer than that he and Adelaida had come for the\n",
      "express purpose of obtaining explanations, and that they suspected him\n",
      "of being concerned in the affair. And if all this were so, then _she_\n",
      "must have some terrible object in view! What was it? There was no\n",
      "stopping _her_, as Muishkin knew from experience, in the performance of\n",
      "anything she had set her mind on! âOh, she is mad, mad!â thought the\n",
      "poor prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there were many other puzzling occurrences that day, which required\n",
      "immediate explanation, and the prince felt very sad. A visit from Vera\n",
      "Lebedeff distracted him a little. She brought the infant Lubotchka with\n",
      "her as usual, and talked cheerfully for some time. Then came her\n",
      "younger sister, and later the brother, who attended a school close by.\n",
      "He informed Muishkin that his father had lately found a new\n",
      "interpretation of the star called âwormwood,â which fell upon the\n",
      "water-springs, as described in the Apocalypse. He had decided that it\n",
      "meant the network of railroads spread over the face of Europe at the\n",
      "present time. The prince refused to believe that Lebedeff could have\n",
      "given such an interpretation, and they decided to ask him about it at\n",
      "the earliest opportunity. Vera related how Keller had taken up his\n",
      "abode with them on the previous evening. She thought he would remain\n",
      "for some time, as he was greatly pleased with the society of General\n",
      "Ivolgin and of the whole family. But he declared that he had only come\n",
      "to them in order to complete his education! The prince always enjoyed\n",
      "the company of Lebedeffâs children, and today it was especially\n",
      "welcome, for Colia did not appear all day. Early that morning he had\n",
      "started for Petersburg. Lebedeff also was away on business. But Gavrila\n",
      "Ardalionovitch had promised to visit Muishkin, who eagerly awaited his\n",
      "coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "About seven in the evening, soon after dinner, he arrived. At the first\n",
      "glance it struck the prince that he, at any rate, must know all the\n",
      "details of last nightâs affair. Indeed, it would have been impossible\n",
      "for him to remain in ignorance considering the intimate relationship\n",
      "between him, Varvara Ardalionovna, and Ptitsin. But although he and the\n",
      "prince were intimate, in a sense, and although the latter had placed\n",
      "the Burdovsky affair in his handsâand this was not the only mark of\n",
      "confidence he had receivedâit seemed curious how many matters there\n",
      "were that were tacitly avoided in their conversations. Muishkin thought\n",
      "that Gania at times appeared to desire more cordiality and frankness.\n",
      "It was apparent now, when he entered, that he was convinced that the\n",
      "moment for breaking the ice between them had come at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all the same Gania was in haste, for his sister was waiting at\n",
      "Lebedeffâs to consult him on an urgent matter of business. If he had\n",
      "anticipated impatient questions, or impulsive confidences, he was soon\n",
      "undeceived. The prince was thoughtful, reserved, even a little\n",
      "absent-minded, and asked none of the questionsâone in particularâthat\n",
      "Gania had expected. So he imitated the princeâs demeanour, and talked\n",
      "fast and brilliantly upon all subjects but the one on which their\n",
      "thoughts were engaged. Among other things Gania told his host that\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna had been only four days in Pavlofsk, and that\n",
      "everyone was talking about her already. She was staying with Daria\n",
      "Alexeyevna, in an ugly little house in Mattrossky Street, but drove\n",
      "about in the smartest carriage in the place. A crowd of followers had\n",
      "pursued her from the first, young and old. Some escorted her on\n",
      "horse-back when she took the air in her carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was as capricious as ever in the choice of her acquaintances, and\n",
      "admitted few into her narrow circle. Yet she already had a numerous\n",
      "following and many champions on whom she could depend in time of need.\n",
      "One gentleman on his holiday had broken off his engagement on her\n",
      "account, and an old general had quarrelled with his only son for the\n",
      "same reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was accompanied sometimes in her carriage by a girl of sixteen, a\n",
      "distant relative of her hostess. This young lady sang very well; in\n",
      "fact, her music had given a kind of notoriety to their little house.\n",
      "Nastasia, however, was behaving with great discretion on the whole. She\n",
      "dressed quietly, though with such taste as to drive all the ladies in\n",
      "Pavlofsk mad with envy, of that, as well as of her beauty and her\n",
      "carriage and horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAs for yesterdayâs episode,â continued Gania, âof course it was\n",
      "pre-arranged.â Here he paused, as though expecting to be asked how he\n",
      "knew that. But the prince did not inquire. Concerning Evgenie\n",
      "Pavlovitch, Gania stated, without being asked, that he believed the\n",
      "former had not known Nastasia Philipovna in past years, but that he had\n",
      "probably been introduced to her by somebody in the park during these\n",
      "four days. As to the question of the IOUâs she had spoken of, there\n",
      "might easily be something in that; for though Evgenie was undoubtedly a\n",
      "man of wealth, yet certain of his affairs were equally undoubtedly in\n",
      "disorder. Arrived at this interesting point, Gania suddenly broke off,\n",
      "and said no more about Nastasiaâs prank of the previous evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Varvara Ardalionovna came in search of her brother, and\n",
      "remained for a few minutes. Without Muishkinâs asking her, she informed\n",
      "him that Evgenie Pavlovitch was spending the day in Petersburg, and\n",
      "perhaps would remain there over tomorrow; and that her husband had also\n",
      "gone to town, probably in connection with Evgenie Pavlovitchâs affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLizabetha Prokofievna is in a really fiendish temper today,â she\n",
      "added, as she went out, âbut the most curious thing is that Aglaya has\n",
      "quarrelled with her whole family; not only with her father and mother,\n",
      "but with her sisters also. It is not a good sign.â She said all this\n",
      "quite casually, though it was extremely important in the eyes of the\n",
      "prince, and went off with her brother. Regarding the episode of\n",
      "âPavlicheffâs son,â Gania had been absolutely silent, partly from a\n",
      "kind of false modesty, partly, perhaps, to âspare the princeâs\n",
      "feelings.â The latter, however, thanked him again for the trouble he\n",
      "had taken in the affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muishkin was glad enough to be left alone. He went out of the garden,\n",
      "crossed the road, and entered the park. He wished to reflect, and to\n",
      "make up his mind as to a certain âstep.â This step was one of those\n",
      "things, however, which are not thought out, as a rule, but decided for\n",
      "or against hastily, and without much reflection. The fact is, he felt a\n",
      "longing to leave all this and go awayâgo anywhere, if only it were far\n",
      "enough, and at once, without bidding farewell to anyone. He felt a\n",
      "presentiment that if he remained but a few days more in this place, and\n",
      "among these people, he would be fixed there irrevocably and\n",
      "permanently. However, in a very few minutes he decided that to run away\n",
      "was impossible; that it would be cowardly; that great problems lay\n",
      "before him, and that he had no right to leave them unsolved, or at\n",
      "least to refuse to give all his energy and strength to the attempt to\n",
      "solve them. Having come to this determination, he turned and went home,\n",
      "his walk having lasted less than a quarter of an hour. At that moment\n",
      "he was thoroughly unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff had not returned, so towards evening Keller managed to\n",
      "penetrate into the princeâs apartments. He was not drunk, but in a\n",
      "confidential and talkative mood. He announced that he had come to tell\n",
      "the story of his life to Muishkin, and had only remained at Pavlofsk\n",
      "for that purpose. There was no means of turning him out; nothing short\n",
      "of an earthquake would have removed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the manner of one with long hours before him, he began his history;\n",
      "but after a few incoherent words he jumped to the conclusion, which was\n",
      "that âhaving ceased to believe in God Almighty, he had lost every\n",
      "vestige of morality, and had gone so far as to commit a theft.â âCould\n",
      "you imagine such a thing?â said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "âListen to me, Keller,â returned the prince. âIf I were in your place,\n",
      "I should not acknowledge that unless it were absolutely necessary for\n",
      "some reason. But perhaps you are making yourself out to be worse than\n",
      "you are, purposely?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI should tell it to no one but yourself, prince, and I only name it\n",
      "now as a help to my soulâs evolution. When I die, that secret will die\n",
      "with me! But, excellency, if you knew, if you only had the least idea,\n",
      "how difficult it is to get money nowadays! Where to find it is the\n",
      "question. Ask for a loan, the answer is always the same: âGive us gold,\n",
      "jewels, or diamonds, and it will be quite easy.â Exactly what one has\n",
      "not got! Can you picture that to yourself? I got angry at last, and\n",
      "said, âI suppose you would accept emeralds?â âCertainly, we accept\n",
      "emeralds with pleasure. Yes!â âWell, thatâs all right,â said I. âGo to\n",
      "the devil, you den of thieves!â And with that I seized my hat, and\n",
      "walked out.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHad you any emeralds?â asked the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat? I have emeralds? Oh, prince! with what simplicity, with what\n",
      "almost pastoral simplicity, you look upon life!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Could not something be made of this man under good influences? asked\n",
      "the prince of himself, for he began to feel a kind of pity for his\n",
      "visitor. He thought little of the value of his own personal influence,\n",
      "not from a sense of humility, but from his peculiar way of looking at\n",
      "things in general. Imperceptibly the conversation grew more animated\n",
      "and more interesting, so that neither of the two felt anxious to bring\n",
      "it to a close. Keller confessed, with apparent sincerity, to having\n",
      "been guilty of many acts of such a nature that it astonished the prince\n",
      "that he could mention them, even to him. At every fresh avowal he\n",
      "professed the deepest repentance, and described himself as being\n",
      "âbathed in tearsâ; but this did not prevent him from putting on a\n",
      "boastful air at times, and some of his stories were so absurdly comical\n",
      "that both he and the prince laughed like madmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOne point in your favour is that you seem to have a child-like mind,\n",
      "and extreme truthfulness,â said the prince at last. âDo you know that\n",
      "that atones for much?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am assuredly noble-minded, and chivalrous to a degree!â said Keller,\n",
      "much softened. âBut, do you know, this nobility of mind exists in a\n",
      "dream, if one may put it so? It never appears in practice or deed. Now,\n",
      "why is that? I can never understand.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo not despair. I think we may say without fear of deceiving\n",
      "ourselves, that you have now given a fairly exact account of your life.\n",
      "I, at least, think it would be impossible to add much to what you have\n",
      "just told me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âImpossible?â cried Keller, almost pityingly. âOh prince, how little\n",
      "you really seem to understand human nature!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs there really much more to be added?â asked the prince, with mild\n",
      "surprise. âWell, what is it you really want of me? Speak out; tell me\n",
      "why you came to make your confession to me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat did I want? Well, to begin with, it is good to meet a man like\n",
      "you. It is a pleasure to talk over my faults with you. I know you for\n",
      "one of the best of men... and then... then...â\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated, and appeared so much embarrassed that the prince helped\n",
      "him out.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen you wanted me to lend you money?â\n",
      "\n",
      "The words were spoken in a grave tone, and even somewhat shyly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keller started, gave an astonished look at the speaker, and thumped the\n",
      "table with his fist.\n",

      "as a fact, yet I recognize that it is an accidental phenomenon, and may\n",
      "likely enough pass away. There can be no such thing anywhere else as a\n",

      "shallâyouâll see it yourselfâyou may be quite assured of it. Some\n",
      "wicked person has been maligning me to you; but itâs all right. Donât\n",
      "worry about it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, the prince approached Aglaya.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took the handkerchief from her face, glanced keenly at him, took in\n",
      "what he had said, and burst out laughingâsuch a merry, unrestrained\n",
      "laugh, so hearty and gay, that Adelaida could not contain herself. She,\n",
      "too, glanced at the princeâs panic-stricken countenance, then rushed at\n",
      "her sister, threw her arms round her neck, and burst into as merry a\n",
      "fit of laughter as Aglayaâs own. They laughed together like a couple of\n",
      "school-girls. Hearing and seeing this, the prince smiled happily, and\n",
      "in accents of relief and joy, he exclaimed âWell, thank Godâthank God!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexandra now joined in, and it looked as though the three sisters were\n",
      "going to laugh on for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThey are insane,â muttered Lizabetha Prokofievna. âEither they\n",
      "frighten one out of oneâs wits, or elseââ\n",
      "\n",
      "But Prince S. was laughing now, too, so was Evgenie Pavlovitch, so was\n",
      "Colia, and so was the prince himself, who caught the infection as he\n",
      "looked round radiantly upon the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome along, letâs go out for a walk!â cried Adelaida. âWeâll all go\n",
      "together, and the prince must absolutely go with us. You neednât go\n",
      "away, you dear good fellow! _Isnât_ he a dear, Aglaya? Isnât he,\n",
      "mother? I must really give him a kiss forâfor his explanation to Aglaya\n",
      "just now. Mother, dear, I may kiss him, maynât I? Aglaya, may I kiss\n",
      "_your_ prince?â cried the young rogue, and sure enough she skipped up\n",
      "to the prince and kissed his forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seized her hands, and pressed them so hard that Adelaida nearly\n",
      "cried out; he then gazed with delight into her eyes, and raising her\n",
      "right hand to his lips with enthusiasm, kissed it three times.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome along,â said Aglaya. âPrince, you must walk with me. May he,\n",
      "mother? This young cavalier, who wonât have me? You said you would\n",
      "_never_ have me, didnât you, prince? Noâno, not like that; _thatâs_ not\n",
      "the way to give your arm. Donât you know how to give your arm to a lady\n",
      "yet? Thereâso. Now, come along, you and I will lead the way. Would you\n",
      "like to lead the way with me alone, tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte?â\n",
      "\n",
      "She went on talking and chatting without a pause, with occasional\n",
      "little bursts of laughter between.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThank Godâthank God!â said Lizabetha Prokofievna to herself, without\n",
      "quite knowing why she felt so relieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat extraordinary people they are!â thought Prince S., for perhaps\n",
      "the hundredth time since he had entered into intimate relations with\n",
      "the family; butâhe liked these âextraordinary people,â all the same. As\n",
      "for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch himself, Prince S. did not seem quite to\n",
      "like him, somehow. He was decidedly preoccupied and a little disturbed\n",
      "as they all started off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitch seemed to be in a lively humour. He made Adelaida\n",
      "and Alexandra laugh all the way to the Vauxhall; but they both laughed\n",
      "so very readily and promptly that the worthy Evgenie began at last to\n",
      "suspect that they were not listening to him at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this idea, he burst out laughing all at once, in quite unaffected\n",
      "mirth, and without giving any explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sisters, who also appeared to be in high spirits, never tired of\n",
      "glancing at Aglaya and the prince, who were walking in front. It was\n",
      "evident that their younger sister was a thorough puzzle to them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince S. tried hard to get up a conversation with Mrs. Epanchin upon\n",
      "outside subjects, probably with the good intention of distracting and\n",
      "amusing her; but he bored her dreadfully. She was absent-minded to a\n",
      "degree, and answered at cross purposes, and sometimes not at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the puzzle and mystery of Aglaya was not yet over for the evening.\n",
      "The last exhibition fell to the lot of the prince alone. When they had\n",
      "proceeded some hundred paces or so from the house, Aglaya said to her\n",
      "obstinately silent cavalier in a quick half-whisper:\n",
      "\n",
      "âLook to the right!â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince glanced in the direction indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLook closer. Do you see that bench, in the park there, just by those\n",
      "three big treesâthat green bench?â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince replied that he saw it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you like the position of it? Sometimes of a morning early, at seven\n",
      "oâclock, when all the rest are still asleep, I come out and sit there\n",
      "alone.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince muttered that the spot was a lovely one.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNow, go away, I donât wish to have your arm any longer; or perhaps,\n",
      "better, continue to give me your arm, and walk along beside me, but\n",
      "donât speak a word to me. I wish to think by myself.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The warning was certainly unnecessary; for the prince would not have\n",
      "said a word all the rest of the time whether forbidden to speak or not.\n",
      "His heart beat loud and painfully when Aglaya spoke of the bench; could\n",
      "sheâbut no! he banished the thought, after an instantâs deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Pavlofsk, on weekdays, the public is more select than it is on\n",
      "Sundays and Saturdays, when the townsfolk come down to walk about and\n",
      "enjoy the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies dress elegantly, on these days, and it is the fashion to\n",
      "gather round the band, which is probably the best of our\n",
      "pleasure-garden bands, and plays the newest pieces. The behaviour of\n",
      "the public is most correct and proper, and there is an appearance of\n",
      "friendly intimacy among the usual frequenters. Many come for nothing\n",
      "but to look at their acquaintances, but there are others who come for\n",
      "the sake of the music. It is very seldom that anything happens to break\n",
      "the harmony of the proceedings, though, of course, accidents will\n",
      "happen everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this particular evening the weather was lovely, and there were a\n",
      "large number of people present. All the places anywhere near the\n",
      "orchestra were occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our friends took chairs near the side exit. The crowd and the music\n",
      "cheered Mrs. Epanchin a little, and amused the girls; they bowed and\n",
      "shook hands with some of their friends and nodded at a distance to\n",
      "others; they examined the ladiesâ dresses, noticed comicalities and\n",
      "eccentricities among the people, and laughed and talked among\n",
      "themselves. Evgenie Pavlovitch, too, found plenty of friends to bow to.\n",
      "Several people noticed Aglaya and the prince, who were still together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before very long two or three young men had come up, and one or two\n",
      "remained to talk; all of these young men appeared to be on intimate\n",
      "terms with Evgenie Pavlovitch. Among them was a young officer, a\n",
      "remarkably handsome fellowâvery good-natured and a great chatterbox. He\n",
      "tried to get up a conversation with Aglaya, and did his best to secure\n",
      "her attention. Aglaya behaved very graciously to him, and chatted and\n",
      "laughed merrily. Evgenie Pavlovitch begged the princeâs leave to\n",
      "introduce their friend to him. The prince hardly realized what was\n",
      "wanted of him, but the introduction came off; the two men bowed and\n",
      "shook hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitchâs friend asked the prince some question, but the\n",
      "latter did not reply, or if he did, he muttered something so strangely\n",
      "indistinct that there was nothing to be made of it. The officer stared\n",
      "intently at him, then glanced at Evgenie, divined why the latter had\n",
      "introduced him, and gave his undivided attention to Aglaya again. Only\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitch observed that Aglaya flushed up for a moment at\n",
      "this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince did not notice that others were talking and making\n",
      "themselves agreeable to Aglaya; in fact, at moments, he almost forgot\n",
      "that he was sitting by her himself. At other moments he felt a longing\n",
      "to go away somewhere and be alone with his thoughts, and to feel that\n",
      "no one knew where he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or if that were impossible he would like to be alone at home, on the\n",
      "terraceâwithout either Lebedeff or his children, or anyone else about\n",
      "him, and to lie there and thinkâa day and night and another day again!\n",
      "He thought of the mountainsâand especially of a certain spot which he\n",
      "used to frequent, whence he would look down upon the distant valleys\n",
      "and fields, and see the waterfall, far off, like a little silver\n",
      "thread, and the old ruined castle in the distance. Oh! how he longed to\n",
      "be there nowâalone with his thoughtsâto think of one thing all his\n",
      "lifeâone thing! A thousand years would not be too much time! And let\n",
      "everyone here forget himâforget him utterly! How much better it would\n",
      "have been if they had never known himâif all this could but prove to be\n",
      "a dream. Perhaps it was a dream!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now and then he looked at Aglaya for five minutes at a time, without\n",
      "taking his eyes off her face; but his expression was very strange; he\n",
      "would gaze at her as though she were an object a couple of miles\n",
      "distant, or as though he were looking at her portrait and not at\n",
      "herself at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy do you look at me like that, prince?â she asked suddenly, breaking\n",
      "off her merry conversation and laughter with those about her. âIâm\n",
      "afraid of you! You look as though you were just going to put out your\n",
      "hand and touch my face to see if itâs real! Doesnât he, Evgenie\n",
      "Pavlovitchâdoesnât he look like that?â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince seemed surprised that he should have been addressed at all;\n",
      "he reflected a moment, but did not seem to take in what had been said\n",
      "to him; at all events, he did not answer. But observing that she and\n",
      "the others had begun to laugh, he too opened his mouth and laughed with\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The laughter became general, and the young officer, who seemed a\n",
      "particularly lively sort of person, simply shook with mirth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aglaya suddenly whispered angrily to herself the wordâ\n",
      "\n",
      "âIdiot!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMy goodnessâsurely she is not in love with such aâsurely she isnât\n",
      "mad!â groaned Mrs. Epanchin, under her breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs all a joke, mamma; itâs just a joke like the âpoor\n",
      "knightâânothing more whatever, I assure you!â Alexandra whispered in\n",
      "her ear. âShe is chaffing himâmaking a fool of him, after her own\n",
      "private fashion, thatâs all! But she carries it just a little too\n",
      "farâshe is a regular little actress. How she frightened us just\n",
      "nowâdidnât she?âand all for a lark!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, itâs lucky she has happened upon an idiot, then, thatâs all I\n",
      "can say!â whispered Lizabetha Prokofievna, who was somewhat comforted,\n",
      "however, by her daughterâs remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince had heard himself referred to as âidiot,â and had shuddered\n",
      "at the moment; but his shudder, it so happened, was not caused by the\n",
      "word applied to him. The fact was that in the crowd, not far from where\n",
      "he was sitting, a pale familiar face, with curly black hair, and a\n",
      "well-known smile and expression, had flashed across his vision for a\n",
      "moment, and disappeared again. Very likely he had imagined it! There\n",
      "only remained to him the impression of a strange smile, two eyes, and a\n",
      "bright green tie. Whether the man had disappeared among the crowd, or\n",
      "whether he had turned towards the Vauxhall, the prince could not say.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a moment or two afterwards he began to glance keenly about him.\n",
      "That first vision might only too likely be the forerunner of a second;\n",
      "it was almost certain to be so. Surely he had not forgotten the\n",
      "possibility of such a meeting when he came to the Vauxhall? True\n",
      "enough, he had not remarked where he was coming to when he set out with\n",
      "Aglaya; he had not been in a condition to remark anything at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had he been more careful to observe his companion, he would have seen\n",
      "that for the last quarter of an hour Aglaya had also been glancing\n",
      "around in apparent anxiety, as though she expected to see someone, or\n",
      "something particular, among the crowd of people. Now, at the moment\n",
      "when his own anxiety became so marked, her excitement also increased\n",
      "visibly, and when he looked about him, she did the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason for their anxiety soon became apparent. From that very side\n",
      "entrance to the Vauxhall, near which the prince and all the Epanchin\n",
      "party were seated, there suddenly appeared quite a large knot of\n",
      "persons, at least a dozen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading this little band walked three ladies, two of whom were\n",
      "remarkably lovely; and there was nothing surprising in the fact that\n",
      "they should have had a large troop of admirers following in their wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was something in the appearance of both the ladies and their\n",
      "admirers which was peculiar, quite different for that of the rest of\n",
      "the public assembled around the orchestra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly everyone observed the little band advancing, and all pretended\n",
      "not to see or notice them, except a few young fellows who exchanged\n",
      "glances and smiled, saying something to one another in whispers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible to avoid noticing them, however, in reality, for they\n",
      "made their presence only too conspicuous by laughing and talking\n",
      "loudly. It was to be supposed that some of them were more than half\n",
      "drunk, although they were well enough dressed, some even particularly\n",
      "well. There were one or two, however, who were very strange-looking\n",
      "creatures, with flushed faces and extraordinary clothes; some were\n",
      "military men; not all were quite young; one or two were middle-aged\n",
      "gentlemen of decidedly disagreeable appearance, men who are avoided in\n",
      "society like the plague, decked out in large gold studs and rings, and\n",
      "magnificently âgot up,â generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among our suburban resorts there are some which enjoy a specially high\n",
      "reputation for respectability and fashion; but the most careful\n",
      "individual is not absolutely exempt from the danger of a tile falling\n",
      "suddenly upon his head from his neighbourâs roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a tile was about to descend upon the elegant and decorous public\n",
      "now assembled to hear the music.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to pass from the Vauxhall to the band-stand, the visitor has\n",
      "to descend two or three steps. Just at these steps the group paused, as\n",
      "though it feared to proceed further; but very quickly one of the three\n",
      "ladies, who formed its apex, stepped forward into the charmed circle,\n",
      "followed by two members of her suite.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these was a middle-aged man of very respectable appearance, but\n",
      "with the stamp of parvenu upon him, a man whom nobody knew, and who\n",
      "evidently knew nobody. The other follower was younger and far less\n",
      "respectable-looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one else followed the eccentric lady; but as she descended the steps\n",
      "she did not even look behind her, as though it were absolutely the same\n",
      "to her whether anyone were following or not. She laughed and talked\n",
      "loudly, however, just as before. She was dressed with great taste, but\n",
      "with rather more magnificence than was needed for the occasion,\n",
      "perhaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked past the orchestra, to where an open carriage was waiting,\n",
      "near the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince had not seen _her_ for more than three months. All these\n",
      "days since his arrival from Petersburg he had intended to pay her a\n",
      "visit, but some mysterious presentiment had restrained him. He could\n",
      "not picture to himself what impression this meeting with her would make\n",
      "upon him, though he had often tried to imagine it, with fear and\n",
      "trembling. One fact was quite certain, and that was that the meeting\n",
      "would be painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several times during the last six months he had recalled the effect\n",
      "which the first sight of this face had had upon him, when he only saw\n",
      "its portrait. He recollected well that even the portrait face had left\n",
      "but too painful an impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "That month in the provinces, when he had seen this woman nearly every\n",
      "day, had affected him so deeply that he could not now look back upon it\n",
      "calmly. In the very look of this woman there was something which\n",
      "tortured him. In conversation with Rogojin he had attributed this\n",
      "sensation to pityâimmeasurable pity, and this was the truth. The sight\n",
      "of the portrait face alone had filled his heart full of the agony of\n",
      "real sympathy; and this feeling of sympathy, nay, of actual\n",
      "_suffering_, for her, had never left his heart since that hour, and was\n",
      "still in full force. Oh yes, and more powerful than ever!\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prince was not satisfied with what he had said to Rogojin. Only\n",
      "at this moment, when she suddenly made her appearance before him, did\n",
      "he realize to the full the exact emotion which she called up in him,\n",
      "and which he had not described correctly to Rogojin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, indeed, there were no words in which he could have expressed his\n",
      "horror, yes, _horror_, for he was now fully convinced from his own\n",
      "private knowledge of her, that the woman was mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, loving a woman above everything in the world, or at least having a\n",
      "foretaste of the possibility of such love for her, one were suddenly to\n",
      "behold her on a chain, behind bars and under the lash of a keeper, one\n",
      "would feel something like what the poor prince now felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhatâs the matter?â asked Aglaya, in a whisper, giving his sleeve a\n",
      "little tug.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned his head towards her and glanced at her black and (for some\n",
      "reason) flashing eyes, tried to smile, and then, apparently forgetting\n",
      "her in an instant, turned to the right once more, and continued to\n",
      "watch the startling apparition before him.\n",
      "\n",

      "chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitch continued some apparently extremely funny and\n",
      "interesting anecdote to Alexandra, speaking quickly and with much\n",

      "a half-whisper:\n",
      "\n",
      "â_What_ aââ\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not finish her indefinite sentence; she restrained herself in a\n",
      "moment; but it was enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna, who up to now had been walking along as though she\n",
      "had not noticed the Epanchin party, suddenly turned her head in their\n",

      "there for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, I declare, here he is!â she cried, stopping suddenly. âThe man\n",

      "just under oneâs nose, exactly where one never thought of looking! I\n",

      "\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitch flushed up and looked angrily at Nastasia\n",

      "departed altogether; some merely exchanged their seats for others a\n",
      "little further off; some were delighted with the occurrence, and talked\n",

      "thought of looking round to the left after he had been pushed so\n",
      "unceremoniously into the chair, he would have observed Aglaya standing\n",
      "some twenty yards away. She had stayed to watch the scandalous scene in\n",
      "spite of her motherâs and sistersâ anxious cries to her to come away.\n",
      "\n",

      "III.\n",

      "The occurrence at the Vauxhall had filled both mother and daughters\n",
      "with something like horror. In their excitement Lizabetha Prokofievna\n",

      "\n",
      "In her opinion there was so much disclosed and laid bare by the\n",

      "able to feel more or less decided on certain points which, up to now,\n",
      "had been in a cloudy condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one and all of the party realized that something important had\n",
      "happened, and that, perhaps fortunately enough, something which had\n",
      "hitherto been enveloped in the obscurity of guess-work had now begun to\n",
      "come forth a little from the mists. In spite of Prince S.âs assurances\n",
      "and explanations, Evgenie Pavlovitchâs real character and position were\n",
      "at last coming to light. He was publicly convicted of intimacy with\n",
      "âthat creature.â So thought Lizabetha Prokofievna and her two elder\n",
      "daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the real upshot of the business was that the number of riddles to\n",
      "be solved was augmented. The two girls, though rather irritated at\n",
      "their motherâs exaggerated alarm and haste to depart from the scene,\n",
      "had been unwilling to worry her at first with questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, they could not help thinking that their sister Aglaya probably\n",

      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince S. looked as black as night, and was silent and moody. Mrs.\n",

      "asking, âwho was the uncle they were talking about, and what was it\n",
      "that had happened in Petersburg?â But he had merely muttered something\n",
      "disconnected about âmaking inquiries,â and that âof course it was all\n",
      "nonsense.â âOh, of course,â replied Adelaida, and asked no more\n",
      "questions. Aglaya, too, was very quiet; and the only remark she made on\n",
      "the way home was that they were âwalking much too fast to be pleasant.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Once she turned and observed the prince hurrying after them. Noticing\n",
      "his anxiety to catch them up, she smiled ironically, and then looked\n",
      "back no more. At length, just as they neared the house, General\n",
      "Epanchin came out and met them; he had only just arrived from town.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first word was to inquire after Evgenie Pavlovitch. But Lizabetha\n",
      "stalked past him, and neither looked at him nor answered his question.\n",
      "\n",
      "He immediately judged from the faces of his daughters and Prince S.\n",
      "that there was a thunderstorm brewing, and he himself already bore\n",
      "evidences of unusual perturbation of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He immediately button-holed Prince S., and standing at the front door,\n",
      "engaged in a whispered conversation with him. By the troubled aspect of\n",
      "both of them, when they entered the house, and approached Mrs.\n",

      "the verandah when he arrived. He settled himself in a corner and sat\n",
      "waiting, though he knew not what he expected. It never struck him that\n",
      "he had better go away, with all this disturbance in the house. He\n",
      "seemed to have forgotten all the world, and to be ready to sit on where\n",
      "he was for years on end. From upstairs he caught sounds of excited\n",
      "conversation every now and then.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not say how long he sat there. It grew late and became quite\n",
      "dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Aglaya entered the verandah. She seemed to be quite calm,\n",
      "though a little pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observing the prince, whom she evidently did not expect to see there,\n",
      "alone in the corner, she smiled, and approached him:\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat are you doing there?â she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince muttered something, blushed, and jumped up; but Aglaya\n",
      "immediately sat down beside him; so he reseated himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked suddenly, but attentively into his face, then at the window,\n",
      "as though thinking of something else, and then again at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPerhaps she wants to laugh at me,â thought the prince, âbut no; for if\n",
      "she did she certainly would do so.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWould you like some tea? Iâll order some,â she said, after a minute or\n",

      "âN-no!âI donât think so. A coward is a man who is afraid and runs away;\n",
      "the man who is frightened but does not run away, is not quite a\n",
      "coward,â said the prince with a smile, after a momentâs thought.\n",

      "\n",
      "âThough I am a woman, I should certainly not run away for anything,â\n",
      "said Aglaya, in a slightly pained voice. âHowever, I see you are\n",
      "laughing at me and twisting your face up as usual in order to make\n",
      "yourself look more interesting. Now tell me, they generally shoot at\n",

      "have aimed at that part of himâpeople never do; he would have aimed at\n",

      "\n",

      "done it.â\n",

      "Her serious air, however, during this conversation had surprised him\n",
      "considerably. He had a feeling that he ought to be asking her\n",
      "something, that there was something he wanted to find out far more\n",
      "important than how to load a pistol; but his thoughts had all\n",
      "scattered, and he was only aware that she was sitting by him, and\n",

      "It appeared that he and the general were going in the same direction.\n",

      "moans and says that we have been âshamed and disgraced.â How? Why?\n",
      "When? By whom? I confess that I am very much to blame myself; I do not\n",
      "conceal the fact; but the conduct, the outrageous behaviour of this\n",
      "woman, must really be kept within limits, by the police if necessary,\n",
      "and I am just on my way now to talk the question over and make some\n",
      "arrangements. It can all be managed quietly and gently, even kindly,\n",
      "and without the slightest fuss or scandal. I foresee that the future is\n",
      "pregnant with events, and that there is much that needs explanation.\n",
      "There is intrigue in the wind; but if on one side nothing is known, on\n",
      "the other side nothing will be explained. If I have heard nothing about\n",
      "it, nor have _you_, nor _he_, nor _she_âwho _has_ heard about it, I\n",

      "people surround her nowadays, and solicit the honour of her\n",
      "âacquaintance.â Of course she might easily have heard the news from\n",
      "someone coming from town. All Petersburg, if not all Pavlofsk, knows it\n",
      "by now. Look at the slyness of her observation about Evgenieâs uniform!\n",
      "I mean, her remark that he had retired just in time! Thereâs a venomous\n",

      "oâclock, and all that; but he might well have had a presentiment of the\n",
      "truth. And Iâall of usâPrince S. and everybody, believed that he was to\n",

      "I donât suspect Evgenie of anything, be quite clear on that point; but\n",
      "the thing is a little suspicious, nevertheless. Prince S. canât get\n",

      "She is enjoying herself like a child, at your expense, and therefore,\n",
      "since she is a child, donât be angry with her, and donât think anything\n",
      "of it. I assure you, she is simply making a fool of you, just as she\n",

      "âTomorrow morning, I shall be at the green bench in the park at seven,\n",
      "and shall wait there for you. I have made up my mind to speak to you\n",
      "about a most important matter which closely concerns yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âP.S.âI trust that you will not show this note to anyone. Though I am\n",
      "ashamed of giving you such instructions, I feel that I must do so,\n",
      "considering what you are. I therefore write the words, and blush for\n",
      "your simple character.\n",
      "\n",
      "âP.P.S.âIt is the same green bench that I showed you before. There!\n",
      "arenât you ashamed of yourself? I felt that it was necessary to repeat\n",
      "even that information.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The note was written and folded anyhow, evidently in a great hurry, and\n",
      "probably just before Aglaya had come down to the verandah.\n",
      "\n",
      "In inexpressible agitation, amounting almost to fear, the prince\n",
      "slipped quickly away from the window, away from the light, like a\n",
      "frightened thief, but as he did so he collided violently with some\n",
      "gentleman who seemed to spring from the earth at his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI was watching for you, prince,â said the individual.\n",

      "âIs that you, Keller?â said the prince, in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, Iâve been looking for you. I waited for you at the Epanchinsâ\n",
      "house, but of course I could not come in. I dogged you from behind as\n",
      "you walked along with the general. Well, prince, here is Keller,\n",
      "absolutely at your serviceâcommand him!âready to sacrifice himselfâeven\n",

      "\n",
      "âButâwhy?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, why?âOf course youâll be challenged! That was young Lieutenant\n",
      "Moloftsoff. I know him, or rather of him; he wonât pass an insult. He\n",
      "will take no notice of Rogojin and myself, and, therefore, you are the\n",
      "only one left to account for. Youâll have to pay the piper, prince. He\n",
      "has been asking about you, and undoubtedly his friend will call on you\n",
      "tomorrowâperhaps he is at your house already. If you would do me the\n",
      "honour to have me for a second, prince, I should be happy. Thatâs why I\n",
      "have been looking for you now.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDuel! Youâve come to talk about a duel, too!â The prince burst out\n",
      "laughing, to the great astonishment of Keller. He laughed\n",
      "unrestrainedly, and Keller, who had been on pins and needles, and in a\n",
      "fever of excitement to offer himself as âsecond,â was very near being\n",
      "offended.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou caught him by the arms, you know, prince. No man of proper pride\n",
      "can stand that sort of treatment in public.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, and he gave me a fearful dig in the chest,â cried the prince,\n",
      "still laughing. âWhat are we to fight about? I shall beg his pardon,\n",
      "thatâs all. But if we must fightâweâll fight! Let him have a shot at\n",
      "me, by all means; I should rather like it. Ha, ha, ha! I know how to\n",
      "load a pistol now; do you know how to load a pistol, Keller? First, you\n",
      "have to buy the powder, you know; it mustnât be wet, and it mustnât be\n",
      "that coarse stuff that they load cannons withâit must be pistol powder.\n",
      "Then you pour the powder in, and get hold of a bit of felt from some\n",
      "door, and then shove the bullet in. But donât shove the bullet in\n",
      "before the powder, because the thing wouldnât go offâdo you hear,\n",
      "Keller, the thing wouldnât go off! Ha, ha, ha! Isnât that a grand\n",
      "reason, Keller, my friend, eh? Do you know, my dear fellow, I really\n",
      "must kiss you, and embrace you, this very moment. Ha, ha! How was it\n",
      "you so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did? Come to my house\n",
      "as soon as you can, and weâll have some champagne. Weâll all get drunk!\n",
      "Do you know I have a dozen of champagne in Lebedeffâs cellar? Lebedeff\n",
      "sold them to me the day after I arrived. I took the lot. Weâll invite\n",
      "everybody! Are you going to do any sleeping tonight?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAs much as usual, princeâwhy?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âPleasant dreams thenâha, ha!â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince crossed the road, and disappeared into the park, leaving the\n",
      "astonished Keller in a state of ludicrous wonder. He had never before\n",
      "seen the prince in such a strange condition of mind, and could not have\n",
      "imagined the possibility of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âFever, probably,â he said to himself, âfor the man is all nerves, and\n",
      "this business has been a little too much for him. He is not _afraid_,\n",
      "thatâs clear; that sort never funks! Hâm! champagne! That was an\n",
      "interesting item of news, at all events!âTwelve bottles! Dear me,\n",
      "thatâs a very respectable little stock indeed! I bet anything Lebedeff\n",
      "lent somebody money on deposit of this dozen of champagne. Hum! heâs a\n",
      "nice fellow, is this prince! I like this sort of man. Well, I neednât\n",
      "be wasting time here, and if itâs a case of champagne, whyâthereâs no\n",
      "time like the present!â\n",
      "\n",
      "That the prince was almost in a fever was no more than the truth. He\n",
      "wandered about the park for a long while, and at last came to himself\n",
      "in a lonely avenue. He was vaguely conscious that he had already paced\n",
      "this particular walkâfrom that large, dark tree to the bench at the\n",
      "other endâabout a hundred yards altogetherâat least thirty times\n",
      "backwards and forwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to recollecting what he had been thinking of all that time, he could\n",
      "not. He caught himself, however, indulging in one thought which made\n",
      "him roar with laughter, though there was nothing really to laugh at in\n",
      "it; but he felt that he must laugh, and go on laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It struck him that the idea of the duel might not have occurred to\n",
      "Keller alone, but that his lesson in the art of pistol-loading might\n",
      "have been not altogether accidental! âPooh! nonsense!â he said to\n",
      "himself, struck by another thought, of a sudden. âWhy, she was\n",
      "immensely surprised to find me there on the verandah, and laughed and\n",
      "talked about _tea!_ And yet she had this little note in her hand,\n",
      "therefore she must have known that I was sitting there. So why was she\n",
      "surprised? Ha, ha, ha!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled the note out and kissed it; then paused and reflected. âHow\n",
      "strange it all is! how strange!â he muttered, melancholy enough now. In\n",
      "moments of great joy, he invariably felt a sensation of melancholy come\n",
      "over himâhe could not tell why.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked intently around him, and wondered why he had come here; he\n",
      "was very tired, so he approached the bench and sat down on it. Around\n",
      "him was profound silence; the music in the Vauxhall was over. The park\n",
      "seemed quite empty, though it was not, in reality, later than half-past\n",
      "eleven. It was a quiet, warm, clear nightâa real Petersburg night of\n",
      "early June; but in the dense avenue, where he was sitting, it was\n",
      "almost pitch dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone had come up at this moment and told him that he was in love,\n",
      "passionately in love, he would have rejected the idea with\n",
      "astonishment, and, perhaps, with irritation. And if anyone had added\n",
      "that Aglayaâs note was a love-letter, and that it contained an\n",
      "appointment to a loverâs rendezvous, he would have blushed with shame\n",
      "for the speaker, and, probably, have challenged him to a duel.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this would have been perfectly sincere on his part. He had never\n",
      "for a moment entertained the idea of the possibility of this girl\n",
      "loving him, or even of such a thing as himself falling in love with\n",
      "her. The possibility of being loved himself, âa man like me,â as he put\n",
      "it, he ranked among ridiculous suppositions. It appeared to him that it\n",
      "was simply a joke on Aglayaâs part, if there really were anything in it\n",
      "at all; but that seemed to him quite natural. His preoccupation was\n",
      "caused by something different.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the few words which the general had let slip about Aglaya\n",
      "laughing at everybody, and at himself most of allâhe entirely believed\n",
      "them. He did not feel the slightest sensation of offence; on the\n",
      "contrary, he was quite certain that it was as it should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "His whole thoughts were now as to next morning early; he would see her;\n",
      "he would sit by her on that little green bench, and listen to how\n",
      "pistols were loaded, and look at her. He wanted nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question as to what she might have to say of special interest to\n",
      "himself occurred to him once or twice. He did not doubt, for a moment,\n",
      "that she really had some such subject of conversation in store, but so\n",
      "very little interested in the matter was he that it did not strike him\n",
      "to wonder what it could be. The crunch of gravel on the path suddenly\n",
      "caused him to raise his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man, whose face it was difficult to see in the gloom, approached the\n",
      "bench, and sat down beside him. The prince peered into his face, and\n",
      "recognized the livid features of Rogojin.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI knew youâd be wandering about somewhere here. I didnât have to look\n",
      "for you very long,â muttered the latter between his teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time they had met since the encounter on the staircase\n",
      "at the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Painfully surprised as he was at this sudden apparition of Rogojin, the\n",
      "prince, for some little while, was unable to collect his thoughts.\n",
      "Rogojin, evidently, saw and understood the impression he had made; and\n",
      "though he seemed more or less confused at first, yet he began talking\n",
      "with what looked like assumed ease and freedom. However, the prince\n",
      "soon changed his mind on this score, and thought that there was not\n",
      "only no affectation of indifference, but that Rogojin was not even\n",
      "particularly agitated. If there were a little apparent awkwardness, it\n",
      "was only in his words and gestures. The man could not change his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow did youâfind me here?â asked the prince for the sake of saying\n",
      "something.\n",
      "\n",
      "âKeller told me (I found him at your place) that you were in the park.\n",
      "âOf course he is!â I thought.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy so?â asked the prince uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin smiled, but did not explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI received your letter, Lef Nicolaievitchâwhatâs the good of all\n",
      "that?âItâs no use, you know. Iâve come to you from _her_,âshe bade me\n",
      "tell you that she must see you, she has something to say to you. She\n",
      "told me to find you today.â\n",

      "\n",
      "âWonât you come?â asked the prince in a gentle voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat an extraordinary man you are! I wonder at you!â Rogojin laughed\n",
      "sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy do you hate me so?â asked the prince, sadly. âYou know yourself\n",
      "that all you suspected is quite unfounded. I felt you were still angry\n",
      "with me, though. Do you know why? Because you tried to kill meâthatâs\n",
      "why you canât shake off your wrath against me. I tell you that I only\n",
      "remember the Parfen Rogojin with whom I exchanged crosses, and vowed\n",
      "brotherhood. I wrote you this in yesterdayâs letter, in order that you\n",
      "might forget all that madness on your part, and that you might not feel\n",
      "called to talk about it when we met. Why do you avoid me? Why do you\n",
      "hold your hand back from me? I tell you again, I consider all that has\n",
      "passed a delirium, an insane dream. I can understand all you did, and\n",
      "all you felt that day, as if it were myself. What you were then\n",
      "imagining was not the case, and could never be the case. Why, then,\n",
      "should there be anger between us?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou donât know what anger is!â laughed Rogojin, in reply to the\n",
      "princeâs heated words.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had moved a pace or two away, and was hiding his hands behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, it is impossible for me to come to your house again,â he added\n",
      "slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy? Do you hate me so much as all that?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât love you, Lef Nicolaievitch, and, therefore, what would be the\n",
      "use of my coming to see you? You are just like a childâyou want a\n",
      "plaything, and it must be taken out and given youâand then you donât\n",

      "I had a presentiment of what you would do, that day, ever since I saw\n",
      "you first in the morning. Do you know yourself what you looked like? I\n",

      "suspecting you all the sameâand you would have intended the murder all\n",
      "the same; therefore we should have been mutually guilty in any case.\n",

      "dislike me too much for that. Why, if I were an angel of light, and as\n",
      "innocent before you as a babe, you would still loathe me if you\n",
      "believed that _she_ loved me, instead of loving yourself. Thatâs\n",

      "his verandah, which was brilliantly lighted up. The company seemed\n",
      "merry and were noisily laughing and talkingâeven quarrelling, to judge\n",
      "from the sounds. At all events they were clearly enjoying themselves,\n",
      "and the prince observed further on closer investigationâthat all had\n",
      "been drinking champagne. To judge from the lively condition of some of\n",
      "the party, it was to be supposed that a considerable quantity of\n",
      "champagne had been consumed already.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the guests were known to the prince; but the curious part of the\n",
      "matter was that they had all arrived on the same evening, as though\n",
      "with one accord, although he had only himself recollected the fact that\n",
      "it was his birthday a few moments since.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou must have told somebody you were going to trot out the champagne,\n",
      "and thatâs why they are all come!â muttered Rogojin, as the two entered\n",
      "the verandah. âWe know all about that! Youâve only to whistle and they\n",
      "come up in shoals!â he continued, almost angrily. He was doubtless\n",
      "thinking of his own late experiences with his boon companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "All surrounded the prince with exclamations of welcome, and, on hearing\n",
      "that it was his birthday, with cries of congratulation and delight;\n",
      "many of them were very noisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of certain of those in the room surprised the prince\n",
      "vastly, but the guest whose advent filled him with the greatest\n",
      "wonderâalmost amounting to alarmâwas Evgenie Pavlovitch. The prince\n",
      "could not believe his eyes when he beheld the latter, and could not\n",
      "help thinking that something was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff ran up promptly to explain the arrival of all these gentlemen.\n",
      "He was himself somewhat intoxicated, but the prince gathered from his\n",
      "long-winded periods that the party had assembled quite naturally, and\n",
      "accidentally.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all Hippolyte had arrived, early in the evening, and feeling\n",
      "decidedly better, had determined to await the prince on the verandah.\n",
      "There Lebedeff had joined him, and his household had followedâthat is,\n",
      "his daughters and General Ivolgin. Burdovsky had brought Hippolyte, and\n",
      "stayed on with him. Gania and Ptitsin had dropped in accidentally later\n",
      "on; then came Keller, and he and Colia insisted on having champagne.\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitch had only dropped in half an hour or so ago. Lebedeff\n",
      "had served the champagne readily.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMy own though, prince, my own, mind,â he said, âand thereâll be some\n",
      "supper later on; my daughter is getting it ready now. Come and sit\n",
      "down, prince, we are all waiting for you, we want you with us. Fancy\n",
      "what we have been discussing! You know the question, âto be or not to\n",
      "be,ââout of Hamlet! A contemporary theme! Quite up-to-date! Mr.\n",
      "Hippolyte has been eloquent to a degree. He wonât go to bed, but he has\n",
      "only drunk a little champagne, and that canât do him any harm. Come\n",
      "along, prince, and settle the question. Everyone is waiting for you,\n",

      "to her. She took it, blushing with delight, and wished him âa happy\n",
      "life from that day forward.â Then she ran off to the kitchen, where her\n",
      "presence was necessary to help in the preparations for supper. Before\n",
      "the princeâs arrival she had spent some time on the terrace, listening\n",
      "eagerly to the conversation, though the visitors, mostly under the\n",
      "influence of wine, were discussing abstract subjects far beyond her\n",
      "comprehension. In the next room her younger sister lay on a wooden\n",
      "chest, sound asleep, with her mouth wide open; but the boy, Lebedeffâs\n",
      "son, had taken up his position close beside Colia and Hippolyte, his\n",
      "face lit up with interest in the conversation of his father and the\n",
      "rest, to which he would willingly have listened for ten hours at a\n",
      "stretch.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have waited for you on purpose, and am very glad to see you arrive\n",

      "and sit down here, quickâIâve been waiting for you!â he added,\n",
      "accentuating the fact that he had waited. On the princeâs asking, âWill\n",
      "it not be injurious to you to sit out so late?â he replied that he\n",
      "could not believe that he had thought himself dying three days or so\n",
      "ago, for he never had felt better than this evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burdovsky next jumped up and explained that he had come in by accident,\n",
      "having escorted Hippolyte from town. He murmured that he was glad he\n",
      "had âwritten nonsenseâ in his letter, and then pressed the princeâs\n",
      "hand warmly and sat down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince approached Evgenie Pavlovitch last of all. The latter\n",
      "immediately took his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have a couple of words to say to you,â he began, âand those on a\n",

      "\n",
      "âJust a couple of words!â whispered another voice in the princeâs other\n",

      "great surprise observed a red, flushed face and a droll-looking figure\n",
      "which he recognized at once as that of Ferdishenko. Goodness knows\n",
      "where he had turned up from!\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you remember Ferdishenko?â he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere have you dropped from?â cried the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe is sorry for his sins now, prince,â cried Keller. âHe did not want\n",
      "to let you know he was here; he was hidden over there in the\n",

      "\n",
      "âYou are very gay here,â began the latter, âand I have had quite a\n",
      "pleasant half-hour while I waited for you. Now then, my dear Lef\n",
      "Nicolaievitch, this is whatâs the matter. Iâve arranged it all with\n",
      "Moloftsoff, and have just come in to relieve your mind on that score.\n",
      "You need be under no apprehensions. He was very sensible, as he should\n",
      "be, of course, for I think he was entirely to blame himself.â\n",

      "âWhat nonsense!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course it is nonsense, and in nonsense it would have ended,\n",

      "\n",
      "âExcuse me, but I think you must have something else that you wished to\n",
      "speak about, Evgenie Pavlovitch?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course, I have!â said the other, laughing. âYou see, my dear\n",
      "fellow, tomorrow, very early in the morning, I must be off to town\n",
      "about this unfortunate business (my uncle, you know!). Just imagine, my\n",
      "dear sir, it is all trueâword for wordâand, of course, everybody knew\n",
      "it excepting myself. All this has been such a blow to me that I have\n",
      "not managed to call in at the Epanchinsâ. Tomorrow I shall not see them\n",
      "either, because I shall be in town. I may not be here for three days or\n",
      "more; in a word, my affairs are a little out of gear. But though my\n",
      "town business is, of course, most pressing, still I determined not to\n",
      "go away until I had seen you, and had a clear understanding with you\n",
      "upon certain points; and that without loss of time. I will wait now, if\n",
      "you will allow me, until the company departs; I may just as well, for I\n",
      "have nowhere else to go to, and I shall certainly not do any sleeping\n",
      "tonight; Iâm far too excited. And finally, I must confess that, though\n",
      "I know it is bad form to pursue a man in this way, I have come to beg\n",
      "your friendship, my dear prince. You are an unusual sort of a person;\n",
      "you donât lie at every step, as some men do; in fact, you donât lie at\n",
      "all, and there is a matter in which I need a true and sincere friend,\n",
      "for I really may claim to be among the number of bona fide unfortunates\n",
      "just now.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut the trouble is,â said the prince, after a slight pause for\n",
      "reflection, âthat goodness only knows when this party will break up.\n",
      "Hadnât we better stroll into the park? Iâll excuse myself, thereâs no\n",
      "danger of their going away.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, no! I have my reasons for wishing them not to suspect us of being\n",
      "engaged in any specially important conversation. There are gentry\n",
      "present who are a little too much interested in us. You are not aware\n",
      "of that perhaps, prince? It will be a great deal better if they see\n",
      "that we are friendly just in an ordinary way. Theyâll all go in a\n",
      "couple of hours, and then Iâll ask you to give me twenty minutesâhalf\n",
      "an hour at most.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBy all means! I assure you I am delightedâyou need not have entered\n",
      "into all these explanations. As for your remarks about friendship with\n",
      "meâthanks, very much indeed. You must excuse my being a little absent\n",
      "this evening. Do you know, I cannot somehow be attentive to anything\n",
      "just now?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI see, I see,â said Evgenie, smiling gently. His mirth seemed very\n",
      "near the surface this evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat do you see?â said the prince, startled.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât want you to suspect that I have simply come here to deceive\n",
      "you and pump information out of you!â said Evgenie, still smiling, and\n",
      "without making any direct reply to the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, but I havenât the slightest doubt that you did come to pump me,â\n",
      "said the prince, laughing himself, at last; âand I dare say you are\n",
      "quite prepared to deceive me too, so far as that goes. But what of\n",
      "that? Iâm not afraid of you; besides, youâll hardly believe it, I feel\n",
      "as though I really didnât care a scrap one way or the other, just\n",
      "now!âAndâandâand as you are a capital fellow, I am convinced of that, I\n",
      "dare say we really shall end by being good friends. I like you very\n",
      "much Evgenie Pavlovitch; I consider you a very good fellow indeed.â\n",

      "more. He was disturbed in his mind, it seemed; perspiration stood in\n",
      "large drops on his forehead; in his gleaming eyes it was easy to read\n",
      "impatience and agitation; his gaze wandered from face to face of those\n",
      "present, and from object to object in the room, apparently without aim.\n",
      "He had taken a part, and an animated one, in the noisy conversation of\n",
      "the company; but his animation was clearly the outcome of fever. His\n",
      "talk was almost incoherent; he would break off in the middle of a\n",
      "sentence which he had begun with great interest, and forget what he had\n",
      "been saying. The prince discovered to his dismay that Hippolyte had\n",
      "been allowed to drink two large glasses of champagne; the one now\n",

      "thereâs no sense in it!âthen we will go to bed. Lebedeff, tell me, is\n",

      "all this parliamentarism of a free people, has an enormous attraction\n",
      "for me. It fascinates me, prince. I have always been an artist in the\n",

      "\n",
      "âDo you mean to say,â cried Gania, from the other corner, âdo you mean\n",

      "of life?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Gavrila Ardalionovitch was in high spirits that evening, and it seemed\n",
      "to the prince that his gaiety was mingled with triumph. Of course he\n",

      "excited himself at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNot the railways, oh dear, no!â replied Lebedeff, with a mixture of\n",
      "violent anger and extreme enjoyment. âConsidered alone, the railways\n",
      "will not pollute the springs of life, but as a whole they are accursed.\n",
      "The whole tendency of our latest centuries, in its scientific and\n",

      "\n",
      "âIs it certainly accursed?... or do you only mean it might be? That is\n",
      "an important point,â said Evgenie Pavlovitch.\n",

      "\n",
      "âBut, on the other hand, more frank in the evening! In the evening\n",
      "sincere and frank,â repeated Lebedeff, earnestly. âMore candid, more\n",
      "exact, more honest, more honourable, and... although I may show you my\n",
      "weak side, I challenge you all; you atheists, for instance! How are you\n",
      "going to save the world? How find a straight road of progress, you men\n",
      "of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the\n",

      "âYou are too inquisitive,â remarked Evgenie Pavlovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, anyone who does not interest himself in questions such as this\n",
      "is, in my opinion, a mere fashionable dummy.â\n",

      "\n",
      "âBut the universal necessity of living, of drinking, of eatingâin\n",
      "short, the whole scientific conviction that this necessity can only be\n",
      "satisfied by universal co-operation and the solidarity of interestsâis,\n",
      "it seems to me, a strong enough idea to serve as a basis, so to speak,\n",
      "and a âspring of life,â for humanity in future centuries,â said Gavrila\n",
      "Ardalionovitch, now thoroughly roused.\n",

      "âWho told you that?â broke in Evgenie Pavlovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is a law, doubtless, but a law neither more nor less normal than\n",
      "that of destruction, even self-destruction. Is it possible that the\n",
      "whole normal law of humanity is contained in this sentiment of\n",
      "self-preservation?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh!â cried Hippolyte, turning towards Evgenie Pavlovitch, and looking\n",
      "at him with a queer sort of curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then seeing that Radomski was laughing, he began to laugh himself,\n",
      "nudged Colia, who was sitting beside him, with his elbow, and again\n",
      "asked what time it was. He even pulled Coliaâs silver watch out of his\n",
      "hand, and looked at it eagerly. Then, as if he had forgotten\n",
      "everything, he stretched himself out on the sofa, put his hands behind\n",
      "his head, and looked up at the sky. After a minute or two he got up and\n",
      "came back to the table to listen to Lebedeffâs outpourings, as the\n",
      "latter passionately commentated on Evgenie Pavlovitchâs paradox.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat is an artful and traitorous idea. A smart notion,â vociferated\n",
      "the clerk, âthrown out as an apple of discord. But it is just. You are\n",
      "a scoffer, a man of the world, a cavalry officer, and, though not\n",
      "without brains, you do not realize how profound is your thought, nor\n",
      "how true. Yes, the laws of self-preservation and of self-destruction\n",
      "are equally powerful in this world. The devil will hold his empire over\n",
      "humanity until a limit of time which is still unknown. You laugh? You\n",
      "do not believe in the devil? Scepticism as to the devil is a French\n",
      "idea, and it is also a frivolous idea. Do you know who the devil is? Do\n",
      "you know his name? Although you donât know his name you make a mockery\n",
      "of his form, following the example of Voltaire. You sneer at his hoofs,\n",
      "at his tail, at his hornsâall of them the produce of your imagination!\n",
      "In reality the devil is a great and terrible spirit, with neither\n",
      "hoofs, nor tail, nor horns; it is you who have endowed him with these\n",
      "attributes! But... he is not the question just now!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow do you know he is not the question now?â cried Hippolyte, laughing\n",
      "hysterically.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnother excellent idea, and worth considering!â replied Lebedeff.\n",
      "âBut, again, that is not the question. The question at this moment is\n",
      "whether we have not weakened âthe springs of lifeâ by the extension...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf railways?â put in Colia eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNot railways, properly speaking, presumptuous youth, but the general\n",
      "tendency of which railways may be considered as the outward expression\n",
      "and symbol. We hurry and push and hustle, for the good of humanity!\n",
      "âThe world is becoming too noisy, too commercial!â groans some solitary\n",
      "thinker. âUndoubtedly it is, but the noise of waggons bearing bread to\n",
      "starving humanity is of more value than tranquillity of soul,â replies\n",
      "another triumphantly, and passes on with an air of pride. As for me, I\n",
      "donât believe in these waggons bringing bread to humanity. For, founded\n",
      "on no moral principle, these may well, even in the act of carrying\n",
      "bread to humanity, coldly exclude a considerable portion of humanity\n",
      "from enjoying it; that has been seen more than once.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat, these waggons may coldly exclude?â repeated someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat has been seen already,â continued Lebedeff, not deigning to\n",
      "notice the interruption. âMalthus was a friend of humanity, but, with\n",
      "ill-founded moral principles, the friend of humanity is the devourer of\n",
      "humanity, without mentioning his pride; for, touch the vanity of one of\n",
      "these numberless philanthropists, and to avenge his self-esteem, he\n",
      "will be ready at once to set fire to the whole globe; and to tell the\n",
      "truth, we are all more or less like that. I, perhaps, might be the\n",
      "first to set a light to the fuel, and then run away. But, again, I must\n",

      "âTo the twelfth century, and those immediately preceding and following\n",

      "days every two or three years, and such was the condition of things\n",
      "that men actually had recourse to cannibalism, in secret, of course.\n",
      "One of these cannibals, who had reached a good age, declared of his own\n",
      "free will that during the course of his long and miserable life he had\n",
      "personally killed and eaten, in the most profound secrecy, sixty monks,\n",
      "not to mention several children; the number of the latter he thought\n",
      "was about six, an insignificant total when compared with the enormous\n",
      "mass of ecclesiastics consumed by him. As to adults, laymen that is to\n",
      "say, he had never touched them.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The president joined in the general outcry.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThatâs impossible!â said he in an aggrieved tone. âI am often\n",
      "discussing subjects of this nature with him, gentlemen, but for the\n",
      "most part he talks nonsense enough to make one deaf: this story has no\n",

      "\n",
      "âIt is quite clear that he did not eat them all at once, but in a space\n",
      "of fifteen or twenty years: from that point of view the thing is\n",
      "comprehensible and natural...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNatural?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd natural,â repeated Lebedeff with pedantic obstinacy. âBesides, a\n",
      "Catholic monk is by nature excessively curious; it would be quite easy\n",
      "therefore to entice him into a wood, or some secret place, on false\n",
      "pretences, and there to deal with him as said. But I do not dispute in\n",
      "the least that the number of persons consumed appears to denote a spice\n",
      "of greediness.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is perhaps true, gentlemen,â said the prince, quietly. He had been\n",
      "listening in silence up to that moment without taking part in the\n",
      "conversation, but laughing heartily with the others from time to time.\n",
      "Evidently he was delighted to see that everybody was amused, that\n",
      "everybody was talking at once, and even that everybody was drinking. It\n",
      "seemed as if he were not intending to speak at all, when suddenly he\n",
      "intervened in such a serious voice that everyone looked at him with\n",
      "interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is true that there were frequent famines at that time, gentlemen. I\n",
      "have often heard of them, though I do not know much history. But it\n",
      "seems to me that it must have been so. When I was in Switzerland I used\n",
      "to look with astonishment at the many ruins of feudal castles perched\n",
      "on the top of steep and rocky heights, half a mile at least above\n",
      "sea-level, so that to reach them one had to climb many miles of stony\n",
      "tracks. A castle, as you know, is, a kind of mountain of stonesâa\n",
      "dreadful, almost an impossible, labour! Doubtless the builders were all\n",
      "poor men, vassals, and had to pay heavy taxes, and to keep up the\n",
      "priesthood. How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had\n",
      "they time to plough and sow their fields? The greater number must,\n",
      "literally, have died of starvation. I have sometimes asked myself how\n",
      "it was that these communities were not utterly swept off the face of\n",
      "the earth, and how they could possibly survive. Lebedeff is not\n",
      "mistaken, in my opinion, when he says that there were cannibals in\n",
      "those days, perhaps in considerable numbers; but I do not understand\n",
      "why he should have dragged in the monks, nor what he means by that.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is undoubtedly because, in the twelfth century, monks were the only\n",

      "\n",
      "âA brilliant idea, and most true!â cried Lebedeff, âfor he never even\n",

      "terrible idea, but it is historic, it is statistic; it is indeed one of\n",
      "those facts which enables an intelligent historian to reconstruct the\n",
      "physiognomy of a special epoch, for it brings out this further point\n",
      "with mathematical accuracy, that the clergy were in those days sixty\n",

      "sixty times fatter also...â\n",

      "\n",
      "âDonât you see he is a lunatic, prince?â whispered Evgenie Pavlovitch\n",
      "in his ear. âSomeone told me just now that he is a bit touched on the\n",

      "the accused, or, as we may say, my client, has often during his\n",

      "eaten five or six children, a relatively insignificant number, no\n",
      "doubt, but remarkable enough from another point of view. It is manifest\n",
      "that, pricked by remorseâfor my client is religious, in his way, and\n",
      "has a conscience, as I shall prove laterâand desiring to extenuate his\n",
      "sin as far as possible, he has tried six times at least to substitute\n",
      "lay nourishment for clerical. That this was merely an experiment we can\n",
      "hardly doubt: for if it had been only a question of gastronomic\n",
      "variety, six would have been too few; why only six? Why not thirty? But\n",
      "if we regard it as an experiment, inspired by the fear of committing\n",
      "new sacrilege, then this number six becomes intelligible. Six attempts\n",
      "to calm his remorse, and the pricking of his conscience, would amply\n",
      "suffice, for these attempts could scarcely have been happy ones. In my\n",
      "humble opinion, a child is too small; I should say, not sufficient;\n",
      "which would result in four or five times more lay children than monks\n",
      "being required in a given time. The sin, lessened on the one hand,\n",
      "would therefore be increased on the other, in quantity, not in quality.\n",
      "Please understand, gentlemen, that in reasoning thus, I am taking the\n",
      "point of view which might have been taken by a criminal of the middle\n",
      "ages. As for myself, a man of the late nineteenth century, I, of\n",
      "course, should reason differently; I say so plainly, and therefore you\n",
      "need not jeer at me nor mock me, gentlemen. As for you, general, it is\n",
      "still more unbecoming on your part. In the second place, and giving my\n",
      "own personal opinion, a childâs flesh is not a satisfying diet; it is\n",
      "too insipid, too sweet; and the criminal, in making these experiments,\n",
      "could have satisfied neither his conscience nor his appetite. I am\n",
      "about to conclude, gentlemen; and my conclusion contains a reply to one\n",
      "of the most important questions of that day and of our own! This\n",
      "criminal ended at last by denouncing himself to the clergy, and giving\n",
      "himself up to justice. We cannot but ask, remembering the penal system\n",
      "of that day, and the tortures that awaited himâthe wheel, the stake,\n",
      "the fire!âwe cannot but ask, I repeat, what induced him to accuse\n",
      "himself of this crime? Why did he not simply stop short at the number\n",
      "sixty, and keep his secret until his last breath? Why could he not\n",
      "simply leave the monks alone, and go into the desert to repent? Or why\n",
      "not become a monk himself? That is where the puzzle comes in! There\n",
      "must have been something stronger than the stake or the fire, or even\n",
      "than the habits of twenty years! There must have been an idea more\n",
      "powerful than all the calamities and sorrows of this world, famine or\n",
      "torture, leprosy or plagueâan idea which entered into the heart,\n",
      "directed and enlarged the springs of life, and made even that hell\n",
      "supportable to humanity! Show me a force, a power like that, in this\n",
      "our century of vices and railways! I might say, perhaps, in our century\n",
      "of steamboats and railways, but I repeat in our century of vices and\n",
      "railways, because I am drunk but truthful! Show me a single idea which\n",
      "unites men nowadays with half the strength that it had in those\n",
      "centuries, and dare to maintain that the âsprings of lifeâ have not\n",
      "been polluted and weakened beneath this âstar,â beneath this network in\n",

      "\n",
      "Here Hippolyte suddenly, and most unexpectedly, pulled out of his\n",

      "\n",
      "The effect of this sudden action upon the company was instantaneous.\n",

      "âAt the first glimpse of the rising sun, prince, I will go to bed. I\n",
      "told you I would, word of honour! You shall see!â cried Hippolyte. âYou\n",
      "think Iâm not capable of opening this packet, do you?â He glared\n",
      "defiantly round at the audience in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince observed that he was trembling all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNone of us ever thought such a thing!â Muishkin replied for all. âWhy\n",

      "What is it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, what is it?â asked others. The packet sealed with red wax seemed\n",
      "to attract everyone, as though it were a magnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI wrote this yesterday, myself, just after I saw you, prince, and told\n",

      "\n",
      "âHadnât we better hear it tomorrow?â asked the prince timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âTomorrow âthere will be no more time!ââ laughed Hippolyte,\n",
      "hysterically. âYou neednât be afraid; I shall get through the whole\n",
      "thing in forty minutes, at most an hour! Look how interested everybody\n",
      "is! Everybody has drawn near. Look! look at them all staring at my\n",

      "effective! Ha, ha! thatâs mystery, that is! Now then, gentlemen, shall\n",
      "I break the seal or not? Say the word; itâs a mystery, I tell youâa\n",
      "secret! Prince, you know who said there would be âno more timeâ? It was\n",
      "the great and powerful angel in the Apocalypse.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBetter not read it now,â said the prince, putting his hand on the\n",
      "packet.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, donât read it!â cried Evgenie suddenly. He appeared so strangely\n",
      "disturbed that many of those present could not help wondering.\n",
      "\n",
      "âReading? None of your reading now!â said somebody; âitâs supper-time.â\n",

      "\n",
      "âThen Iâm not to read it?â he whispered, nervously. âAm I not to read\n",
      "it?â he repeated, gazing around at each face in turn. âWhat are you\n",
      "afraid of, prince?â he turned and asked the latter suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat should I be afraid of?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHas anyone a coin about them? Give me a twenty-copeck piece,\n",
      "somebody!â And Hippolyte leapt from his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHere you are,â said Lebedeff, handing him one; he thought the boy had\n",
      "gone mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "âVera Lukianovna,â said Hippolyte, âtoss it, will you? Heads, I read,\n",
      "tails, I donât.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Vera Lebedeff tossed the coin into the air and let it fall on the\n",
      "table.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was âheads.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen I read it,â said Hippolyte, in the tone of one bowing to the fiat\n",
      "of destiny. He could not have grown paler if a verdict of death had\n",
      "suddenly been presented to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut after all, what is it? Is it possible that I should have just\n",
      "risked my fate by tossing up?â he went on, shuddering; and looked round\n",
      "him again. His eyes had a curious expression of sincerity. âThat is an\n",
      "astonishing psychological fact,â he cried, suddenly addressing the\n",
      "prince, in a tone of the most intense surprise. âIt is... it is\n",
      "something quite inconceivable, prince,â he repeated with growing\n",
      "animation, like a man regaining consciousness. âTake note of it,\n",
      "prince, remember it; you collect, I am told, facts concerning capital\n",
      "punishment... They told me so. Ha, ha! My God, how absurd!â He sat down\n",
      "on the sofa, put his elbows on the table, and laid his head on his\n",
      "hands. âIt is shamefulâthough what does it matter to me if it is\n",
      "shameful?\n",
      "\n",
      "âGentlemen, gentlemen! I am about to break the seal,â he continued,\n",
      "with determination. âIâIâof course I donât insist upon anyone listening\n",
      "if they do not wish to.â\n",
      "\n",
      "With trembling fingers he broke the seal and drew out several sheets of\n",
      "paper, smoothed them out before him, and began sorting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat on earth does all this mean? Whatâs he going to read?â muttered\n",
      "several voices. Others said nothing; but one and all sat down and\n",
      "watched with curiosity. They began to think something strange might\n",
      "really be about to happen. Vera stood and trembled behind her fatherâs\n",
      "chair, almost in tears with fright; Colia was nearly as much alarmed as\n",
      "she was. Lebedeff jumped up and put a couple of candles nearer to\n",
      "Hippolyte, so that he might see better.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGentlemen, thisâyouâll soon see what this is,â began Hippolyte, and\n",
      "suddenly commenced his reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs headed, âA Necessary Explanation,â with the motto, â_AprÃ¨s moi le\n",

      "Hippolyte glanced at him suddenly, and when their eyes met Rogojin\n",
      "showed his teeth in a disagreeable smile, and said the following\n",
      "strange words: âThatâs not the way to settle this business, my friend;\n",
      "thatâs not the way at all.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course nobody knew what Rogojin meant by this; but his words made a\n",

      "\n",
      "As for Hippolyte, their effect upon him was astounding. He trembled so\n",
      "that the prince was obliged to support him, and would certainly have\n",
      "cried out, but that his voice seemed to have entirely left him for the\n",
      "moment. For a minute or two he could not speak at all, but panted and\n",
      "stared at Rogojin. At last he managed to ejaculate:\n",

      "\n",
      "âCame where? What do you mean?â asked Rogojin, amazed. But Hippolyte,\n",

      "The prince made after him, but it so happened that at this moment\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitch stretched out his hand to say good-night. The next\n",

      "indescribable excitement.\n",

      "pocket all the while, when he was speaking to the prince, and that he\n",
      "had held the latterâs shoulder with his left hand only. This\n",
      "circumstance, Keller affirmed, had led him to feel some suspicion from\n",
      "the first. However this may be, Keller ran after Hippolyte, but he was\n",
      "too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught sight of something flashing in Hippolyteâs right hand, and\n",
      "saw that it was a pistol. He rushed at him, but at that very instant\n",
      "Hippolyte raised the pistol to his temple and pulled the trigger. There\n",
      "followed a sharp metallic click, but no report.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Keller seized the would-be suicide, the latter fell forward into\n",
      "his arms, probably actually believing that he was shot. Keller had hold\n",
      "of the pistol now. Hippolyte was immediately placed in a chair, while\n",
      "the whole company thronged around excitedly, talking and asking each\n",
      "other questions. Every one of them had heard the snap of the trigger,\n",
      "and yet they saw a live and apparently unharmed man before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolyte himself sat quite unconscious of what was going on, and gazed\n",

      "\n",
      "âPerhaps it wasnât loaded,â said several voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs loaded all right,â said Keller, examining the pistol, âbutââ\n",

      "It would be difficult to describe the pitiable scene that now followed.\n",
      "The first sensation of alarm soon gave place to amusement; some burst\n",
      "out laughing loud and heartily, and seemed to find a malicious\n",
      "satisfaction in the joke. Poor Hippolyte sobbed hysterically; he wrung\n",
      "his hands; he approached everyone in turnâeven Ferdishenkoâand took\n",
      "them by both hands, and swore solemnly that he had forgottenâabsolutely\n",
      "forgottenââaccidentally, and not on purpose,ââto put a cap inâthat he\n",
      "âhad ten of them, at least, in his pocket.â He pulled them out and\n",
      "showed them to everyone; he protested that he had not liked to put one\n",
      "in beforehand for fear of an accidental explosion in his pocket. That\n",
      "he had thought he would have lots of time to put it in afterwardsâwhen\n",
      "requiredâand, that, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten all\n",
      "about it. He threw himself upon the prince, then on Evgenie Pavlovitch.\n",
      "He entreated Keller to give him back the pistol, and heâd soon show\n",
      "them all that âhis honourâhis honour,ââbut he was âdishonoured, now,\n",

      "daughter, with Burdovsky and General Ivolgin, remained by the sick\n",
      "manâs couch.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was carried away unconscious, Keller stood in the middle of the\n",

      "a loud tone of voice, with emphasis upon each word.\n",
      "\n",
      "âGentlemen, if any one of you casts any doubt again, before me, upon\n",
      "Hippolyteâs good faith, or hints that the cap was forgotten\n",
      "intentionally, or suggests that this unhappy boy was acting a part\n",
      "before us, I beg to announce that the person so speaking shall account\n",
      "to me for his words.â\n",
      "\n",
      "No one replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company departed very quickly, in a mass. Ptitsin, Gania, and\n",
      "Rogojin went away together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was much astonished that Evgenie Pavlovitch changed his\n",
      "mind, and took his departure without the conversation he had requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?â he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "âQuite so,â said Evgenie, sitting down suddenly beside him, âbut I have\n",
      "changed my mind for the time being. I confess, I am too disturbed, and\n",
      "so, I think, are you; and the matter as to which I wished to consult\n",
      "you is too serious to tackle with oneâs mind even a little disturbed;\n",
      "too serious both for myself and for you. You see, prince, for once in\n",
      "my life I wish to perform an absolutely honest action, that is, an\n",
      "action with no ulterior motive; and I think I am hardly in a condition\n",
      "to talk of it just at this moment, andâandâwell, weâll discuss it\n",
      "another time. Perhaps the matter may gain in clearness if we wait for\n",
      "two or three daysâjust the two or three days which I must spend in\n",
      "Petersburg.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he rose again from his chair, so that it seemed strange that he\n",
      "should have thought it worth while to sit down at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince thought, too, that he looked vexed and annoyed, and not\n",
      "nearly so friendly towards himself as he had been earlier in the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI suppose you will go to the suffererâs bedside now?â he added.\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, you neednât fear! Heâll live another six weeks all right. Very\n",
      "likely he will recover altogether; but I strongly advise you to pack\n",
      "him off tomorrow.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI think I may have offended him by saying nothing just now. I am\n",
      "afraid he may suspect that I doubted his good faith,âabout shooting\n",
      "himself, you know. What do you think, Evgenie Pavlovitch?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNot a bit of it! You are much too good to him; you shouldnât care a\n",
      "hang about what he thinks. I have heard of such things before, but\n",
      "never came across, till tonight, a man who would actually shoot himself\n",
      "in order to gain a vulgar notoriety, or blow out his brains for spite,\n",
      "if he finds that people donât care to pat him on the back for his\n",
      "sanguinary intentions. But what astonishes me more than anything is the\n",
      "fellowâs candid confession of weakness. Youâd better get rid of him\n",
      "tomorrow, in any case.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you think he will make another attempt?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh no, not he, not now! But you have to be very careful with this sort\n",
      "of gentleman. Crime is too often the last resource of these petty\n",
      "nonentities. This young fellow is quite capable of cutting the throats\n",
      "of ten people, simply for a lark, as he told us in his âexplanation.â I\n",
      "assure you those confounded words of his will not let me sleep.â\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âWhat an extraordinary person you are, prince! Do you mean to say that\n",
      "you doubt the fact that he is capable of murdering ten men?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI darenât say, one way or the other; all this is very strangeâbutââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, as you like, just as you like,â said Evgenie Pavlovitch,\n",
      "irritably. âOnly you are such a plucky fellow, take care you donât get\n",
      "included among the ten victims!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, he is much more likely not to kill anyone at all,â said the\n",
      "prince, gazing thoughtfully at Evgenie. The latter laughed\n",
      "disagreeably.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, _au revoir!_ Did you observe that he âwilledâ a copy of his\n",

      "âYes, I did; I am thinking of it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIn connection with âthe ten,â eh?â laughed Evgenie, as he left the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour later, towards four oâclock, the prince went into the park. He\n",
      "had endeavoured to fall asleep, but could not, owing to the painful\n",
      "beating of his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had left things quiet and peaceful; the invalid was fast asleep, and\n",
      "the doctor, who had been called in, had stated that there was no\n",
      "special danger. Lebedeff, Colia, and Burdovsky were lying down in the\n",
      "sick-room, ready to take it in turns to watch. There was nothing to\n",
      "fear, therefore, at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the princeâs mental perturbation increased every moment. He\n",
      "wandered about the park, looking absently around him, and paused in\n",
      "astonishment when he suddenly found himself in the empty space with the\n",
      "rows of chairs round it, near the Vauxhall. The look of the place\n",
      "struck him as dreadful now: so he turned round and went by the path\n",
      "which he had followed with the Epanchins on the way to the band, until\n",
      "he reached the green bench which Aglaya had pointed out for their\n",
      "rendezvous. He sat down on it and suddenly burst into a loud fit of\n",
      "laughter, immediately followed by a feeling of irritation. His\n",
      "disturbance of mind continued; he felt that he must go away somewhere,\n",
      "anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above his head some little bird sang out, of a sudden; he began to peer\n",
      "about for it among the leaves. Suddenly the bird darted out of the tree\n",
      "and away, and instantly he thought of the âfly buzzing about in the\n",
      "sunâs raysâ that Hippolyte had talked of; how that it knew its place\n",
      "and was a participator in the universal life, while he alone was an\n",
      "âoutcast.â This picture had impressed him at the time, and he meditated\n",
      "upon it now. An old, forgotten memory awoke in his brain, and suddenly\n",
      "burst into clearness and light. It was a recollection of Switzerland,\n",
      "during the first year of his cure, the very first months. At that time\n",
      "he had been pretty nearly an idiot still; he could not speak properly,\n",
      "and had difficulty in understanding when others spoke to him. He\n",
      "climbed the mountain-side, one sunny morning, and wandered long and\n",
      "aimlessly with a certain thought in his brain, which would not become\n",
      "clear. Above him was the blazing sky, below, the lake; all around was\n",
      "the horizon, clear and infinite. He looked out upon this, long and\n",
      "anxiously. He remembered how he had stretched out his arms towards the\n",
      "beautiful, boundless blue of the horizon, and wept, and wept. What had\n",
      "so tormented him was the idea that he was a stranger to all this, that\n",
      "he was outside this glorious festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was this universe? What was this grand, eternal pageant to which\n",
      "he had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take\n",
      "part? Every morning the same magnificent sun; every morning the same\n",
      "rainbow in the waterfall; every evening the same glow on the\n",
      "snow-mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every little fly that buzzed in the sunâs rays was a singer in the\n",
      "universal chorus, âknew its place, and was happy in it.â Every blade of\n",
      "grass grew and was happy. Everything knew its path and loved it, went\n",
      "forth with a song and returned with a song; only he knew nothing,\n",
      "understood nothing, neither men nor words, nor any of natureâs voices;\n",
      "he was a stranger and an outcast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, he could not then speak these words, or express all he felt! He had\n",
      "been tormented dumbly; but now it appeared to him that he must have\n",
      "said these very wordsâeven thenâand that Hippolyte must have taken his\n",
      "picture of the little fly from his tears and words of that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was sure of it, and his heart beat excitedly at the thought, he knew\n",
      "not why.\n",
      "\n",
      "He fell asleep on the bench; but his mental disquiet continued through\n",
      "his slumbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before he dozed off, the idea of Hippolyte murdering ten men\n",
      "flitted through his brain, and he smiled at the absurdity of such a\n",
      "thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around him all was quiet; only the flutter and whisper of the leaves\n",
      "broke the silence, but broke it only to cause it to appear yet more\n",

      "nothing, but simply longed to see human faces once more, and to hear\n",
      "human praise and feel human affection. Who knows? Only it all came out\n",
      "wrong, somehow. Some people have luck, and everything comes out right\n",

      "âHâmâwell, at all events, I shouldnât have fallen asleep here, in your\n",

      "you sit down?â\n",
      "\n",

      "clearly expressed in her eyes, which flashed like fire. As a rule, she\n",
      "vented her wrath on her unfortunate companion, be it who it might. She\n",
      "was very conscious of her own shyness, and was not nearly so talkative\n",
      "as her sisters for this reasonâin fact, at times she was much too\n",
      "quiet. When, therefore, she was bound to talk, especially at such\n",

      "otherwise with more of the ancient knight about him than of the modern\n",
      "liberal. He was with the sick man at first, but came over afterwards\n",

      "all over! So I said to him, âNonsense, general; if anybody but yourself\n",
      "had said that to me, Iâd have taken my head, my own head, and put it on\n",
      "a large dish and carried it round to anyone who suspected you; and I\n",

      "too.â There,â says I, âthatâs how Iâd answer for you, general!â Then he\n",

      "because he was really a man of peaceful and kindly disposition. He had\n",
      "tried hundreds of times to overcome the dissolute habits which he had\n",
      "contracted of late years. He would suddenly remember that he was âa\n",
      "father,â would be reconciled with his wife, and shed genuine tears. His\n",
      "feeling for Nina Alexandrovna amounted almost to adoration; she had\n",

      "of degradation into which he had fallen. But the generalâs struggles\n",
      "with his own weakness never lasted very long. He was, in his way, an\n",
      "impetuous man, and a quiet life of repentance in the bosom of his\n",

      "flew into rages which he regretted, perhaps, even as he gave way to\n",
      "them, but which were beyond his control. He picked quarrels with\n",
      "everyone, began to hold forth eloquently, exacted unlimited respect,\n",
      "and at last disappeared from the house, and sometimes did not return\n",

      "occasionsâbut, on the contrary, in an uncommonly bad temper. He had\n",
      "arrived in a quarrelsome mood, pitching into everyone he came across,\n",
      "and talking about all sorts and kinds of subjects in the most\n",
      "unexpected manner, so that it was impossible to discover what it was\n",
      "that was really putting him out. At moments he would be apparently\n",
      "quite bright and happy; but as a rule he would sit moody and\n",
      "thoughtful. He would abruptly commence to hold forth about the\n",
      "Epanchins, about Lebedeff, or the prince, and equally abruptly would\n",
      "stop short and refuse to speak another word, answering all further\n",
      "questions with a stupid smile, unconscious that he was smiling, or that\n",
      "he had been asked a question. The whole of the previous night he had\n",
      "spent tossing about and groaning, and poor Nina Alexandrovna had been\n",
      "busy making cold compresses and warm fomentations and so on, without\n",
      "being very clear how to apply them. He had fallen asleep after a while,\n",
      "but not for long, and had awaked in a state of violent hypochondria\n",
      "which had ended in his quarrel with Hippolyte, and the solemn cursing\n",
      "of Ptitsinâs establishment generally. It was also observed during those\n",
      "two or three days that he was in a state of morbid self-esteem, and was\n",
      "specially touchy on all points of honour. Colia insisted, in discussing\n",
      "the matter with his mother, that all this was but the outcome of\n",
      "abstinence from drink, or perhaps of pining after Lebedeff, with whom\n",
      "up to this time the general had been upon terms of the greatest\n",
      "friendship; but with whom, for some reason or other, he had quarrelled\n",
      "a few days since, parting from him in great wrath. There had also been\n",

      "painted him; and it was hardly likely that he had informed Nina\n",
      "Alexandrovna of certain events, of which we know, for the mere pleasure\n",
      "of giving her pain. We must never forget that human motives are\n",
      "generally far more complicated than we are apt to suppose, and that we\n",
      "can very rarely accurately describe the motives of another. It is much\n",
      "better for the writer, as a rule, to content himself with the bare\n",
      "statement of events; and we shall take this line with regard to the\n",
      "catastrophe recorded above, and shall state the remaining events\n",
      "connected with the generalâs trouble shortly, because we feel that we\n",
      "have already given to this secondary character in our story more\n",
      "attention than we originally intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course of events had marched in the following order. When Lebedeff\n",
      "returned, in company with the general, after their expedition to town a\n",
      "few days since, for the purpose of investigation, he brought the prince\n",
      "no information whatever. If the latter had not himself been occupied\n",
      "with other thoughts and impressions at the time, he must have observed\n",
      "that Lebedeff not only was very uncommunicative, but even appeared\n",
      "anxious to avoid him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the prince did give the matter a little attention, he recalled the\n",
      "fact that during these days he had always found Lebedeff to be in\n",
      "radiantly good spirits, when they happened to meet; and further, that\n",
      "the general and Lebedeff were always together. The two friends did not\n",
      "seem ever to be parted for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Occasionally the prince heard loud talking and laughing upstairs, and\n",
      "once he detected the sound of a jolly soldierâs song going on above,\n",
      "and recognized the unmistakable bass of the generalâs voice. But the\n",
      "sudden outbreak of song did not last; and for an hour afterwards the\n",
      "animated sound of apparently drunken conversation continued to be heard\n",
      "from above. At length there was the clearest evidence of a grand mutual\n",
      "embracing, and someone burst into tears. Shortly after this, however,\n",
      "there was a violent but short-lived quarrel, with loud talking on both\n",
      "sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these days Colia had been in a state of great mental preoccupation.\n",
      "Muishkin was usually out all day, and only came home late at night. On\n",
      "his return he was invariably informed that Colia had been looking for\n",
      "him. However, when they did meet, Colia never had anything particular\n",
      "to tell him, excepting that he was highly dissatisfied with the general\n",
      "and his present condition of mind and behaviour.\n",
      "\n",

      "four hundred roubles that you lost that day. You came and told me about\n",

      "\n",
      "âVery simply indeed! I found it under the chair upon which my coat had\n",

      "on to the floor!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âUnder the chair? Impossible! Why, you told me yourself that you had\n",

      "most likely place of all?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course I looked there,âof course I did! Very much so! I looked and\n",
      "scrambled about, and felt for it, and wouldnât believe it was not\n",
      "there, and looked again and again. It is always so in such cases. One\n",
      "longs and expects to find a lost article; one sees it is not there, and\n",
      "the place is as bare as oneâs palm; and yet one returns and looks again\n",
      "and again, fifteen or twenty times, likely enough!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, quite so, of course. But how was it in your case?âI donât quite\n",
      "understand,â said the bewildered prince. âYou say it wasnât there at\n",
      "first, and that you searched the place thoroughly, and yet it turned up\n",
      "on that very spot!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, sirâon that very spot.â The prince gazed strangely at Lebedeff.\n",
      "âAnd the general?â he asked, abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âTheâthe general? How do you mean, the general?â said Lebedeff,\n",
      "dubiously, as though he had not taken in the drift of the princeâs\n",
      "remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, good heavens! I mean, what did the general say when the purse\n",
      "turned up under the chair? You and he had searched for it together\n",
      "there, hadnât you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âQuite soâtogether! But the second time I thought better to say nothing\n",
      "about finding it. I found it alone.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âButâwhy in the worldâand the money? Was it all there?â\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âI think you might have come and told me,â said the prince,\n",
      "thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOhâI didnât like to disturb you, prince, in the midst of your private\n",
      "and doubtless most interesting personal reflections. Besides, I wanted\n",
      "to appear, myself, to have found nothing. I took the purse, and opened\n",
      "it, and counted the money, and shut it and put it down again under the\n",
      "chair.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat in the world for?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, just out of curiosity,â said Lebedeff, rubbing his hands and\n",
      "sniggering.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat, itâs still there then, is it? Ever since the day before\n",
      "yesterday?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh no! You see, I was half in hopes the general might find it. Because\n",
      "if I found it, why should not he too observe an object lying before his\n",
      "very eyes? I moved the chair several times so as to expose the purse to\n",
      "view, but the general never saw it. He is very absent just now,\n",
      "evidently. He talks and laughs and tells stories, and suddenly flies\n",
      "into a rage with me, goodness knows why.â\n",
      "\n",

      "Look, you can feel it for yourself, if you like!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure enough there was something sticking out of the front of the\n",

      "purse fallen through a hole in the pocket into the lining.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI took it out and had a look at it; itâs all right. Iâve let it slip\n",
      "back into the lining now, as you see, and so I have been walking about\n",
      "ever since yesterday morning; it knocks against my legs when I walk\n",
      "along.â\n",

      "âHâm! and you take no notice of it?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âQuite so, I take no notice of it. Ha, ha! and think of this, prince,\n",
      "my pockets are always strong and whole, and yet, here in one night, is\n",
      "a huge hole. I know the phenomenon is unworthy of your notice; but such\n",
      "is the case. I examined the hole, and I declare it actually looks as\n",
      "though it had been made with a pen-knife, a most improbable\n",
      "contingency.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAndâandâthe general?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAh, very angry all day, sir; all yesterday and all today. He shows\n",
      "decided bacchanalian predilections at one time, and at another is\n",
      "tearful and sensitive, but at any moment he is liable to paroxysms of\n",
      "such rage that I assure you, prince, I am quite alarmed. I am not a\n",
      "military man, you know. Yesterday we were sitting together in the\n",
      "tavern, and the lining of my coat wasâquite accidentally, of\n",
      "courseâsticking out right in front. The general squinted at it, and\n",
      "flew into a rage. He never looks me quite in the face now, unless he is\n",
      "very drunk or maudlin; but yesterday he looked at me in such a way that\n",
      "a shiver went all down my back. I intend to find the purse tomorrow;\n",
      "but till then I am going to have another night of it with him.â\n",
      "\n",

      "âI love him, my dear sir, I esteem him; and believe it or not, I love\n",
      "him all the better for this business, yesâand value him more.â\n",

      "\n",
      "âNonsense! love him and torment him so! Why, by the very fact that he\n",
      "put the purse prominently before you, first under the chair and then in\n",
      "your lining, he shows that he does not wish to deceive you, but is\n",
      "anxious to beg your forgiveness in this artless way. Do you hear? He is\n",
      "asking your pardon. He confides in the delicacy of your feelings, and\n",
      "in your friendship for him. And you can allow yourself to humiliate so\n",
      "thoroughly honest a man!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThoroughly honest, quite so, prince, thoroughly honest!â said\n",

      "so very appropriate an expression. I honour you for it, prince. Very\n",
      "well, thatâs settled; I shall find the purse now and not tomorrow.\n",
      "Here, I find it and take it out before your eyes! And the money is all\n",
      "right. Take it, prince, and keep it till tomorrow, will you? Tomorrow\n",
      "or next day Iâll take it back again. I think, prince, that the night\n",
      "after its disappearance it was buried under a bush in the garden. So I\n",
      "believeâwhat do you think of that?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, take care you donât tell him to his face that you have found the\n",
      "purse. Simply let him see that it is no longer in the lining of your\n",
      "coat, and form his own conclusions.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDo you think so? Had I not just better tell him I have found it, and\n",
      "pretend I never guessed where it was?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, I donât think so,â said the prince, thoughtfully; âitâs too late\n",
      "for thatâthat would be dangerous now. No, no! Better say nothing about\n",
      "it. Be nice with him, you know, but donât show himâoh, _you_ know well\n",
      "enoughââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âI know, prince, of course I know, but Iâm afraid I shall not carry it\n",
      "out; for to do so one needs a heart like your own. He is so very\n",
      "irritable just now, and so proud. At one moment he will embrace me, and\n",
      "the next he flies out at me and sneers at me, and then I stick the\n",
      "lining forward on purpose. Well, _au revoir_, prince, I see I am\n",

      "glance, he saw that the latter was displeased, perhaps because he had\n",
      "been kept waiting. The prince apologized, and quickly took a seat. He\n",
      "seemed strangely timid before the general this morning, for some\n",
      "reason, and felt as though his visitor were some piece of china which\n",
      "he was afraid of breaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "On scrutinizing him, the prince soon saw that the general was quite a\n",
      "different man from what he had been the day before; he looked like one\n",
      "who had come to some momentous resolve. His calmness, however, was more\n",
      "apparent than real. He was courteous, but there was a suggestion of\n",
      "injured innocence in his manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâve brought your book back,â he began, indicating a book lying on the\n",

      "\n",
      "âAh, yes. Well, did you read it, general? Itâs curious, isnât it?â said\n",

      "her house? Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this\n",
      "matter? So far as she could see, nothing whatever had happened. Surely\n",
      "they had better wait and see what was to happen, instead of making\n",
      "mountains out of molehills.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so the conclusion of the matter was that it would be far better to\n",
      "take it quietly, and wait coolly to see what would turn up. But, alas!\n",
      "peace did not reign for more than ten minutes. The first blow dealt to\n",
      "its power was in certain news communicated to Lizabetha Prokofievna as\n",
      "to events which had happened during her trip to see the princess. (This\n",
      "trip had taken place the day after that on which the prince had turned\n",
      "up at the Epanchins at nearly one oâclock at night, thinking it was\n",
      "nine.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The sisters replied candidly and fully enough to their motherâs\n",
      "impatient questions on her return. They said, in the first place, that\n",
      "nothing particular had happened since her departure; that the prince\n",
      "had been, and that Aglaya had kept him waiting a long while before she\n",
      "appearedâhalf an hour, at least; that she had then come in, and\n",
      "immediately asked the prince to have a game of chess; that the prince\n",
      "did not know the game, and Aglaya had beaten him easily; that she had\n",
      "been in a wonderfully merry mood, and had laughed at the prince, and\n",
      "chaffed him so unmercifully that one was quite sorry to see his\n",
      "wretched expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had then asked him to play cardsâthe game called âlittle fools.â At\n",
      "this game the tables were turned completely, for the prince had shown\n",
      "himself a master at it. Aglaya had cheated and changed cards, and\n",
      "stolen others, in the most bare-faced way, but, in spite of everything\n",
      "the prince had beaten her hopelessly five times running, and she had\n",
      "been left âlittle foolâ each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aglaya then lost her temper, and began to say such awful things to the\n",
      "prince that he laughed no more, but grew dreadfully pale, especially\n",
      "when she said that she should not remain in the house with him, and\n",
      "that he ought to be ashamed of coming to their house at all, especially\n",
      "at night, â_after all that had happened_.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, she had left the room, banging the door after her, and the\n",
      "prince went off, looking as though he were on his way to a funeral, in\n",
      "spite of all their attempts at consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, a quarter of an hour after the princeâs departure, Aglaya had\n",
      "rushed out of her room in such a hurry that she had not even wiped her\n",
      "eyes, which were full of tears. She came back because Colia had brought\n",
      "a hedgehog. Everybody came in to see the hedgehog. In answer to their\n",
      "questions Colia explained that the hedgehog was not his, and that he\n",
      "had left another boy, Kostia Lebedeff, waiting for him outside. Kostia\n",
      "was too shy to come in, because he was carrying a hatchet; they had\n",
      "bought the hedgehog and the hatchet from a peasant whom they had met on\n",
      "the road. He had offered to sell them the hedgehog, and they had paid\n",
      "fifty copecks for it; and the hatchet had so taken their fancy that\n",
      "they had made up their minds to buy it of their own accord. On hearing\n",
      "this, Aglaya urged Colia to sell her the hedgehog; she even called him\n",
      "âdear Colia,â in trying to coax him. He refused for a long time, but at\n",
      "last he could hold out no more, and went to fetch Kostia Lebedeff. The\n",
      "latter appeared, carrying his hatchet, and covered with confusion. Then\n",
      "it came out that the hedgehog was not theirs, but the property of a\n",
      "schoolmate, one Petroff, who had given them some money to buy\n",
      "Schlosserâs History for him, from another schoolfellow who at that\n",
      "moment was driven to raising money by the sale of his books. Colia and\n",
      "Kostia were about to make this purchase for their friend when chance\n",
      "brought the hedgehog to their notice, and they had succumbed to the\n",
      "temptation of buying it. They were now taking Petroff the hedgehog and\n",
      "hatchet which they had bought with his money, instead of Schlosserâs\n",
      "History. But Aglaya so entreated them that at last they consented to\n",
      "sell her the hedgehog. As soon as she had got possession of it, she put\n",
      "it in a wicker basket with Coliaâs help, and covered it with a napkin.\n",
      "Then she said to Colia: âGo and take this hedgehog to the prince from\n",
      "me, and ask him to accept it as a token of my profound respect.â Colia\n",
      "joyfully promised to do the errand, but he demanded explanations. âWhat\n",
      "does the hedgehog mean? What is the meaning of such a present?â Aglaya\n",
      "replied that it was none of his business. âI am sure that there is some\n",
      "allegory about it,â Colia persisted. Aglaya grew angry, and called him\n",
      "âa silly boy.â âIf I did not respect all women in your person,â replied\n",
      "Colia, âand if my own principles would permit it, I would soon prove to\n",
      "you, that I know how to answer such an insult!â But, in the end, Colia\n",
      "went off with the hedgehog in great delight, followed by Kostia\n",
      "Lebedeff. Aglayaâs annoyance was soon over, and seeing that Colia was\n",
      "swinging the hedgehogâs basket violently to and fro, she called out to\n",
      "him from the verandah, as if they had never quarrelled: âColia, dear,\n",
      "please take care not to drop him!â Colia appeared to have no grudge\n",
      "against her, either, for he stopped, and answered most cordially: âNo,\n",
      "I will not drop him! Donât be afraid, Aglaya Ivanovna!â After which he\n",
      "went on his way. Aglaya burst out laughing and ran up to her room,\n",
      "highly delighted. Her good spirits lasted the whole day.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this filled poor Lizabethaâs mind with chaotic confusion. What on\n",
      "earth did it all mean? The most disturbing feature was the hedgehog.\n",
      "What was the symbolic signification of a hedgehog? What did they\n",
      "understand by it? What underlay it? Was it a cryptic message?\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor General Epanchin âput his foot in itâ by answering the above\n",
      "questions in his own way. He said there was no cryptic message at all.\n",
      "As for the hedgehog, it was just a hedgehog, which meant\n",
      "nothingâunless, indeed, it was a pledge of friendship,âthe sign of\n",
      "forgetting of offences and so on. At all events, it was a joke, and, of\n",
      "course, a most pardonable and innocent one.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may as well remark that the general had guessed perfectly\n",
      "accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince, returning home from the interview with Aglaya, had sat\n",
      "gloomy and depressed for half an hour. He was almost in despair when\n",
      "Colia arrived with the hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the sky cleared in a moment. The prince seemed to arise from the\n",
      "dead; he asked Colia all about it, made him repeat the story over and\n",
      "over again, and laughed and shook hands with the boys in his delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed clear to the prince that Aglaya forgave him, and that he\n",
      "might go there again this very evening; and in his eyes that was not\n",
      "only the main thing, but everything in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat children we are still, Colia!â he cried at last,\n",
      "enthusiastically,ââand how delightful it is that we can be children\n",
      "still!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSimplyâmy dear prince,âsimply she is in love with you,âthatâs the\n",
      "whole of the secret!â replied Colia, with authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince blushed, but this time he said nothing. Colia burst out\n",
      "laughing and clapped his hands. A minute later the prince laughed too,\n",
      "and from this moment until the evening he looked at his watch every\n",
      "other minute to see how much time he had to wait before evening came.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the situation was becoming rapidly critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Epanchin could bear her suspense no longer, and in spite of the\n",
      "opposition of husband and daughters, she sent for Aglaya, determined to\n",
      "get a straightforward answer out of her, once for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOtherwise,â she observed hysterically, âI shall die before evening.â\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only now that everyone realized to what a ridiculous dead-lock\n",
      "the whole matter had been brought. Excepting feigned surprise,\n",
      "indignation, laughter, and jeeringâboth at the prince and at everyone\n",
      "who asked her questions,ânothing could be got out of Aglaya.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizabetha Prokofievna went to bed and only rose again in time for tea,\n",
      "when the prince might be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "She awaited him in trembling agitation; and when he at last arrived she\n",
      "nearly went off into hysterics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muishkin himself came in very timidly. He seemed to feel his way, and\n",
      "looked in each personâs eyes in a questioning way,âfor Aglaya was\n",
      "absent, which fact alarmed him at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "This evening there were no strangers presentâno one but the immediate\n",
      "members of the family. Prince S. was still in town, occupied with the\n",
      "affairs of Evgenie Pavlovitchâs uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI wish at least _he_ would come and say something!â complained poor\n",

      "\n",
      "The general sat still with a most preoccupied air. The sisters were\n",
      "looking very serious and did not speak a word, and Lizabetha\n",
      "Prokofievna did not know how to commence the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length she plunged into an energetic and hostile criticism of\n",
      "railways, and glared at the prince defiantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas Aglaya still did not comeâand the prince was quite lost. He had\n",
      "the greatest difficulty in expressing his opinion that railways were\n",
      "most useful institutions,âand in the middle of his speech Adelaida\n",
      "laughed, which threw him into a still worse state of confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment in marched Aglaya, as calm and collected as could be.\n",
      "She gave the prince a ceremonious bow and solemnly took up a prominent\n",
      "position near the big round table. She looked at the prince\n",
      "questioningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "All present realized that the moment for the settlement of perplexities\n",
      "had arrived.\n",

      "\n",
      "âTell us now, at once, what you made of the present? I must have you\n",

      "all the rest of the family!â\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "suddenly alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is not in the least beyond all limits, mamma!â said her daughter,\n",
      "firmly. âI sent the prince a hedgehog this morning, and I wish to hear\n",
      "his opinion of it. Go on, prince.â\n",
      "\n",

      "I am anxious to be able to clear up this accumulation of\n",
      "misunderstandings. Allow me to ask you, prince,âI wish to hear from\n",

      "\n",
      "âGracious heavens!â exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna. The prince\n",
      "started. The general stiffened in his chair; the sisters frowned.\n",

      "\n",
      "âI have not asked you to marry me yet, Aglaya Ivanovna,â said the\n",

      "\n",
      "There was nothing, however, of love-making in his talk. His ideas were\n",

      "less melancholy; but towards night, the prince fell to telling funny\n",
      "stories, and was always the first to burst out laughing himself, which\n",

      "\n",
      "âShe looked at him, and stared and stared, and hung on every word he\n",

      "\n",
      "The happy state in which the family had spent the evening, as just\n",
      "recorded, was not of very long duration. Next day Aglaya quarrelled\n",
      "with the prince again, and so she continued to behave for the next few\n",
      "days. For whole hours at a time she ridiculed and chaffed the wretched\n",

      "\n",
      "Suddenly Prince S. hinted something about âa new and approaching change\n",

      "weddings might come off together.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible to describe Aglayaâs irritation. She flared up, and\n",
      "said some indignant words about âall these silly insinuations.â She\n",
      "added that âshe had no intentions as yet of replacing anybodyâs\n",
      "mistress.â\n",
      "\n",
      "These words painfully impressed the whole party; but especially her\n",
      "parents. Lizabetha Prokofievna summoned a secret council of two, and\n",
      "insisted upon the generalâs demanding from the prince a full\n",
      "explanation of his relations with Nastasia Philipovna. The general\n",
      "argued that it was only a whim of Aglayaâs; and that, had not Prince S.\n",
      "unfortunately made that remark, which had confused the child and made\n",
      "her blush, she never would have said what she did; and that he was sure\n",
      "Aglaya knew well that anything she might have heard of the prince and\n",

      "and that the woman was going to marry Rogojin. He insisted that the\n",
      "prince had nothing whatever to do with Nastasia Philipovna, so far as\n",
      "any liaison was concerned; and, if the truth were to be told about it,\n",
      "he added, never had had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile nothing put the prince out, and he continued to be in the\n",
      "seventh heaven of bliss. Of course he could not fail to observe some\n",
      "impatience and ill-temper in Aglaya now and then; but he believed in\n",
      "something else, and nothing could now shake his conviction. Besides,\n",
      "Aglayaâs frowns never lasted long; they disappeared of themselves.\n",
      "\n",

      "He had approached the prince with the intention of talking\n",
      "sarcastically about his happy expression of face, but very soon forgot\n",

      "was talking nonsense; he knew that he ought not to speak at all, and\n",
      "yet he talked the whole time; he seemed to be trying to persuade them\n",

      "\n",
      "âEarly?â said Lebedeff, sarcastically. âTime counts for nothing, even\n",

      "was moral.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly took a seat, very unceremoniously, and began his story. It\n",

      "\n",
      "In the first place he began about some letter; the name of Aglaya\n",
      "Ivanovna came in. Then suddenly he broke off and began to accuse the\n",

      "declared that the prince had trusted him with his confidences as to âa\n",
      "certain personâ (Nastasia Philipovna), but that of late his friendship\n",
      "had been thrust back into his bosom, and his innocent question as to\n",
      "âapproaching family changesâ had been curtly put aside, which Lebedeff\n",

      "have sent up a letter to the noble lady, stating that I have a matter\n",
      "of great importance to communicate. She received the letter; I know she\n",

      "\n",
      "âYes, I saw her, and got the said slap in the face as mentioned. She\n",
      "chucked the letter back to me unopened, and kicked me out of the house,\n",

      "might be sent on to the address given.\n",
      "\n",
      "âJust as before, sir, just as before! To a certain person, and from a\n",

      "hideous grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he kept jumping from subject to subject, and forgetting what he had\n",
      "begun to talk about, the prince said nothing, but waited, to give him\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very vague. Who had taken the letters, if letters there\n",
      "were? Probably Veraâand how could Lebedeff have got them? In all\n",
      "probability, he had managed to steal the present letter from Vera, and\n",
      "had himself gone over to Lizabetha Prokofievna with some idea in his\n",
      "head. So the prince concluded at last.\n",

      "\n",
      "âNot quite, esteemed prince,â replied Lebedeff, with some acerbity. âI\n",

      "to yourself, but I decided that it would pay me better to deliver it up\n",

      "âWell? Go on.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, well, when I saw her she almost punched my head, as I say; in fact\n",
      "so nearly that one might almost say she did punch my head. She threw\n",
      "the letter in my face; she seemed to reflect first, as if she would\n",
      "have liked to keep it, but thought better of it and threw it in my face\n",
      "instead. âIf anybody can have been such a fool as to trust a man like\n",
      "you to deliver the letter,â says she, âtake it and deliver it!â Hey!\n",
      "she was grandly indignant. A fierce, fiery lady that, sir!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhereâs the letter now?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, Iâve still got it, here!â\n",
      "\n",
      "And he handed the prince the very letter from Aglaya to Gania, which\n",
      "the latter showed with so much triumph to his sister at a later hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis letter cannot be allowed to remain in your hands.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs for youâfor you! Iâve brought it you on purpose!â cried Lebedeff,\n",
      "excitedly. âWhy, Iâm yours again now, heart and hand, your slave; there\n",
      "was but a momentary pause in the flow of my love and esteem for you.\n",
      "Mea culpa, mea culpa! as the Pope of Rome says.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThis letter should be sent on at once,â said the prince, disturbed.\n",

      "you knowââ\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff made a strange and very expressive grimace; he twisted about\n",
      "in his chair, and did something, apparently symbolical, with his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat do you mean?â said the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, open it, for the time being, donât you know?â he said, most\n",
      "confidentially and mysteriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince jumped up so furiously that Lebedeff ran towards the door;\n",
      "having gained which strategic position, however, he stopped and looked\n",
      "back to see if he might hope for pardon.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, Lebedeff, Lebedeff! Can a man really sink to such depths of\n",
      "meanness?â said the prince, sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeffâs face brightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, Iâm a mean wretchâa mean wretch!â he said, approaching the prince\n",
      "once more, and beating his breast, with tears in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs abominable dishonesty, you know!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDishonestyâit is, it is! Thatâs the very word!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat in the world induces you to act so? You are nothing but a spy.\n",
      "Why did you write anonymously to worry so noble and generous a lady?\n",
      "Why should not Aglaya Ivanovna write a note to whomever she pleases?\n",
      "What did you mean to complain of today? What did you expect to get by\n",
      "it? What made you go at all?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âPure amiable curiosity,âI assure youâdesire to do a service. Thatâs\n",
      "all. Now Iâm entirely yours again, your slave; hang me if you like!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDid you go before Lizabetha Prokofievna in your present condition?â\n",
      "inquired the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNoâoh no, fresherâmore the correct card. I only became this like after\n",
      "the humiliation I suffered there.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWellâthatâll do; now leave me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "This injunction had to be repeated several times before the man could\n",
      "be persuaded to move. Even then he turned back at the door, came as far\n",
      "as the middle of the room, and there went through his mysterious\n",
      "motions designed to convey the suggestion that the prince should open\n",
      "the letter. He did not dare put his suggestion into words again.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this performance, he smiled sweetly and left the room on tiptoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this had been very painful to listen to. One fact stood out certain\n",
      "and clear, and that was that poor Aglaya must be in a state of great\n",
      "distress and indecision and mental torment (âfrom jealousy,â the prince\n",
      "whispered to himself). Undoubtedly in this inexperienced, but hot and\n",
      "proud little head, there were all sorts of plans forming, wild and\n",
      "impossible plans, maybe; and the idea of this so frightened the prince\n",
      "that he could not make up his mind what to do. Something must be done,\n",
      "that was clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the address on the letter once more. Oh, he was not in the\n",
      "least degree alarmed about Aglaya writing such a letter; he could trust\n",
      "her. What he did not like about it was that he could not trust Gania.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he made up his mind that he would himself take the note and\n",
      "deliver it. Indeed, he went so far as to leave the house and walk up\n",
      "the road, but changed his mind when he had nearly reached Ptitsinâs\n",
      "door. However, he there luckily met Colia, and commissioned him to\n",
      "deliver the letter to his brother as if direct from Aglaya. Colia asked\n",
      "no questions but simply delivered it, and Gania consequently had no\n",
      "suspicion that it had passed through so many hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived home again, the prince sent for Vera Lebedeff and told her as\n",
      "much as was necessary, in order to relieve her mind, for she had been\n",
      "in a dreadful state of anxiety since she had missed the letter. She\n",
      "heard with horror that her father had taken it. Muishkin learned from\n",
      "her that she had on several occasions performed secret missions both\n",
      "for Aglaya and for Rogojin, without, however, having had the slightest\n",
      "idea that in so doing she might injure the prince in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter, with one thing and another, was now so disturbed and\n",
      "confused, that when, a couple of hours or so later, a message came from\n",
      "Colia that the general was ill, he could hardly take the news in.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when he did master the fact, it acted upon him as a tonic by\n",
      "completely distracting his attention. He went at once to Nina\n",
      "Alexandrovnaâs, whither the general had been carried, and stayed there\n",
      "until the evening. He could do no good, but there are people whom to\n",
      "have near one is a blessing at such times. Colia was in an almost\n",
      "hysterical state; he cried continuously, but was running about all day,\n",
      "all the same; fetching doctors, of whom he collected three; going to\n",
      "the chemistâs, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general was brought round to some extent, but the doctors declared\n",
      "that he could not be said to be out of danger. Varia and Nina\n",
      "Alexandrovna never left the sick manâs bedside; Gania was excited and\n",
      "distressed, but would not go upstairs, and seemed afraid to look at the\n",
      "patient. He wrung his hands when the prince spoke to him, and said that\n",
      "âsuch a misfortune at such a momentâ was terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince thought he knew what Gania meant by âsuch a moment.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolyte was not in the house. Lebedeff turned up late in the\n",
      "afternoon; he had been asleep ever since his interview with the prince\n",
      "in the morning. He was quite sober now, and cried with real sincerity\n",
      "over the sick generalâmourning for him as though he were his own\n",
      "brother. He blamed himself aloud, but did not explain why. He repeated\n",
      "over and over again to Nina Alexandrovna that he alone was to blameâno\n",
      "one elseâbut that he had acted out of âpure amiable curiosity,â and\n",
      "that âthe deceased,â as he insisted upon calling the still living\n",
      "general, had been the greatest of geniuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid much stress on the genius of the sufferer, as if this idea must\n",
      "be one of immense solace in the present crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nina Alexandrovnaâseeing his sincerity of feelingâsaid at last, and\n",
      "without the faintest suspicion of reproach in her voice: âCome,\n",
      "comeâdonât cry! God will forgive you!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff was so impressed by these words, and the tone in which they\n",
      "were spoken, that he could not leave Nina Alexandrovna all the\n",
      "eveningâin fact, for several days. Till the generalâs death, indeed, he\n",
      "spent almost all his time at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice during the day a messenger came to Nina Alexandrovna from the\n",
      "Epanchins to inquire after the invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenâlate in the eveningâthe prince made his appearance in Lizabetha\n",
      "Prokofievnaâs drawing-room, he found it full of guests. Mrs. Epanchin\n",
      "questioned him very fully about the general as soon as he appeared; and\n",
      "when old Princess Bielokonski wished to know âwho this general was, and\n",
      "who was Nina Alexandrovna,â she proceeded to explain in a manner which\n",
      "pleased the prince very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "He himself, when relating the circumstances of the generalâs illness to\n",
      "Lizabetha Prokofievna, âspoke beautifully,â as Aglayaâs sisters\n",
      "declared afterwardsââmodestly, quietly, without gestures or too many\n",
      "words, and with great dignity.â He had entered the room with propriety\n",
      "and grace, and he was perfectly dressed; he not only did not âfall down\n",
      "on the slippery floor,â as he had expressed it, but evidently made a\n",
      "very favourable impression upon the assembled guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for his own impression on entering the room and taking his seat, he\n",
      "instantly remarked that the company was not in the least such as\n",
      "Aglayaâs words had led him to fear, and as he had dreamed ofâin\n",
      "nightmare formâall night.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the first time in his life that he had seen a little corner of\n",
      "what was generally known by the terrible name of âsociety.â He had long\n",
      "thirsted, for reasons of his own, to penetrate the mysteries of the\n",
      "magic circle, and, therefore, this assemblage was of the greatest\n",
      "possible interest to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first impression was one of fascination. Somehow or other he felt\n",
      "that all these people must have been born on purpose to be together! It\n",
      "seemed to him that the Epanchins were not having a party at all; that\n",
      "these people must have been here always, and that he himself was one of\n",
      "themâreturned among them after a long absence, but one of them,\n",
      "naturally and indisputably.\n",
      "\n",
      "It never struck him that all this refined simplicity and nobility and\n",
      "wit and personal dignity might possibly be no more than an exquisite\n",
      "artistic polish. The majority of the guestsâwho were somewhat\n",
      "empty-headed, after all, in spite of their aristocratic bearingânever\n",
      "guessed, in their self-satisfied composure, that much of their\n",
      "superiority was mere veneer, which indeed they had adopted\n",
      "unconsciously and by inheritance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince would never so much as suspect such a thing in the delight\n",
      "of his first impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw, for instance, that one important dignitary, old enough to be\n",
      "his grandfather, broke off his own conversation in order to listen to\n",
      "_him_âa young and inexperienced man; and not only listened, but seemed\n",
      "to attach value to his opinion, and was kind and amiable, and yet they\n",
      "were strangers and had never seen each other before. Perhaps what most\n",
      "appealed to the princeâs impressionability was the refinement of the\n",
      "old manâs courtesy towards him. Perhaps the soil of his susceptible\n",
      "nature was really predisposed to receive a pleasant impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile all these peopleâthough friends of the family and of each\n",
      "other to a certain extentâwere very far from being such intimate\n",
      "friends of the family and of each other as the prince concluded. There\n",
      "were some present who never would think of considering the Epanchins\n",
      "their equals. There were even some who hated one another cordially. For\n",
      "instance, old Princess Bielokonski had all her life despised the wife\n",
      "of the âdignitary,â while the latter was very far from loving Lizabetha\n",
      "Prokofievna. The dignitary himself had been General Epanchinâs\n",
      "protector from his youth up; and the general considered him so majestic\n",
      "a personage that he would have felt a hearty contempt for himself if he\n",
      "had even for one moment allowed himself to pose as the great manâs\n",
      "equal, or to think of himâin his fear and reverenceâas anything less\n",
      "than an Olympic God! There were others present who had not met for\n",
      "years, and who had no feeling whatever for each other, unless it were\n",
      "dislike; and yet they met tonight as though they had seen each other\n",
      "but yesterday in some friendly and intimate assembly of kindred\n",
      "spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a large party, however. Besides Princess Bielokonski and the\n",
      "old dignitary (who was really a great man) and his wife, there was an\n",
      "old military generalâa count or baron with a German name, a man reputed\n",
      "to possess great knowledge and administrative ability. He was one of\n",
      "those Olympian administrators who know everything except Russia,\n",
      "pronounce a word of extraordinary wisdom, admired by all, about once in\n",
      "five years, and, after being an eternity in the service, generally die\n",
      "full of honour and riches, though they have never done anything great,\n",
      "and have even been hostile to all greatness. This general was Ivan\n",
      "Fedorovitchâs immediate superior in the service; and it pleased the\n",
      "latter to look upon him also as a patron. On the other hand, the great\n",
      "man did not at all consider himself Epanchinâs patron. He was always\n",
      "very cool to him, while taking advantage of his ready services, and\n",
      "would instantly have put another in his place if there had been the\n",
      "slightest reason for the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another guest was an elderly, important-looking gentleman, a distant\n",
      "relative of Lizabetha Prokofievnaâs. This gentleman was rich, held a\n",
      "good position, was a great talker, and had the reputation of being âone\n",
      "of the dissatisfied,â though not belonging to the dangerous sections of\n",
      "that class. He had the manners, to some extent, of the English\n",
      "aristocracy, and some of their tastes (especially in the matter of\n",
      "under-done roast beef, harness, men-servants, etc.). He was a great\n",
      "friend of the dignitaryâs, and Lizabetha Prokofievna, for some reason\n",
      "or other, had got hold of the idea that this worthy intended at no\n",
      "distant date to offer the advantages of his hand and heart to\n",
      "Alexandra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the elevated and more solid individuals enumerated, there were\n",
      "present a few younger though not less elegant guests. Besides Prince S.\n",
      "and Evgenie Pavlovitch, we must name the eminent and fascinating Prince\n",
      "N.âonce the vanquisher of female hearts all over Europe. This gentleman\n",
      "was no longer in the first bloom of youthâhe was forty-five, but still\n",
      "very handsome. He was well off, and lived, as a rule, abroad, and was\n",
      "noted as a good teller of stories. Then came a few guests belonging to\n",
      "a lower stratum of societyâpeople who, like the Epanchins themselves,\n",
      "moved only occasionally in this exalted sphere. The Epanchins liked to\n",
      "draft among their more elevated guests a few picked representatives of\n",
      "this lower stratum, and Lizabetha Prokofievna received much praise for\n",
      "this practice, which proved, her friends said, that she was a woman of\n",
      "tact. The Epanchins prided themselves upon the good opinion people held\n",
      "of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the representatives of the middle-class present today was a\n",
      "colonel of engineers, a very serious man and a great friend of Prince\n",
      "S., who had introduced him to the Epanchins. He was extremely silent in\n",
      "society, and displayed on the forefinger of his right hand a large\n",
      "ring, probably bestowed upon him for services of some sort. There was\n",
      "also a poet, German by name, but a Russian poet; very presentable, and\n",
      "even handsomeâthe sort of man one could bring into society with\n",
      "impunity. This gentleman belonged to a German family of decidedly\n",
      "bourgeois origin, but he had a knack of acquiring the patronage of\n",
      "âbig-wigs,â and of retaining their favour. He had translated some great\n",
      "German poem into Russian verse, and claimed to have been a friend of a\n",
      "famous Russian poet, since dead. (It is strange how great a multitude\n",
      "of literary people there are who have had the advantages of friendship\n",
      "with some great man of their own profession who is, unfortunately,\n",
      "dead.) The dignitaryâs wife had introduced this worthy to the\n",
      "Epanchins. This lady posed as the patroness of literary people, and she\n",
      "certainly had succeeded in obtaining pensions for a few of them, thanks\n",
      "to her influence with those in authority on such matters. She was a\n",
      "lady of weight in her own way. Her age was about forty-five, so that\n",
      "she was a very young wife for such an elderly husband as the dignitary.\n",
      "She had been a beauty in her day and still loved, as many ladies of\n",
      "forty-five do love, to dress a little too smartly. Her intellect was\n",
      "nothing to boast of, and her literary knowledge very doubtful. Literary\n",
      "patronage was, however, with her as much a mania as was the love of\n",
      "gorgeous clothes. Many books and translations were dedicated to her by\n",
      "her proteges, and a few of these talented individuals had published\n",
      "some of their own letters to her, upon very weighty subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, then, was the society that the prince accepted at once as true\n",
      "coin, as pure gold without alloy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so happened, however, that on this particular evening all these good\n",
      "people were in excellent humour and highly pleased with themselves.\n",
      "Every one of them felt that they were doing the Epanchins the greatest\n",
      "possible honour by their presence. But alas! the prince never suspected\n",
      "any such subtleties! For instance, he had no suspicion of the fact that\n",
      "the Epanchins, having in their mind so important a step as the marriage\n",
      "of their daughter, would never think of presuming to take it without\n",
      "having previously âshown offâ the proposed husband to the dignitaryâthe\n",
      "recognized patron of the family. The latter, too, though he would\n",
      "probably have received news of a great disaster to the Epanchin family\n",
      "with perfect composure, would nevertheless have considered it a\n",
      "personal offence if they had dared to marry their daughter without his\n",
      "advice, or we might almost say, his leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amiable and undoubtedly witty Prince N. could not but feel that he\n",
      "was as a sun, risen for one night only to shine upon the Epanchin\n",
      "drawing-room. He accounted them immeasurably his inferiors, and it was\n",
      "this feeling which caused his special amiability and delightful ease\n",
      "and grace towards them. He knew very well that he must tell some story\n",
      "this evening for the edification of the company, and led up to it with\n",
      "the inspiration of anticipatory triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince, when he heard the story afterwards, felt that he had never\n",
      "yet come across so wonderful a humorist, or such remarkable brilliancy\n",
      "as was shown by this man; and yet if he had only known it, this story\n",
      "was the oldest, stalest, and most worn-out yarn, and every drawing-room\n",
      "in town was sick to death of it. It was only in the innocent Epanchin\n",
      "household that it passed for a new and brilliant taleâas a sudden and\n",
      "striking reminiscence of a splendid and talented man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the German poet, though as amiable as possible, felt that he was\n",
      "doing the house the greatest of honours by his presence in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prince only looked at the bright side; he did not turn the coat\n",
      "and see the shabby lining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aglaya had not foreseen that particular calamity. She herself looked\n",
      "wonderfully beautiful this evening. All three sisters were dressed very\n",
      "tastefully, and their hair was done with special care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aglaya sat next to Evgenie Pavlovitch, and laughed and talked to him\n",
      "with an unusual display of friendliness. Evgenie himself behaved rather\n",
      "more sedately than usual, probably out of respect to the dignitary.\n",
      "Evgenie had been known in society for a long while. He had appeared at\n",
      "the Epanchinsâ today with crape on his hat, and Princess Bielokonski\n",

      "\n",
      "Little by little he became very happy indeed. All his late anxieties\n",

      "\n",
      "Little by little a sort of inspiration, however, began to stir within\n",
      "him, ready to spring into life at the right moment. When he did begin\n",

      "story about something or otherâsuddenly this gentleman pronounced the\n",
      "name of âNicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheffâ aloud. The prince quickly\n",
      "turned towards him, and listened.\n",

      "sell it at half its value. âTo avoid another lawsuit about the\n",

      "having travelled about in the central provinces during these last six\n",
      "months without having hunted up his two old friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "He declared, further, that he had intended to go every day, but had\n",
      "always been prevented by circumstances; but that now he would promise\n",
      "himself the pleasureâhowever far it was, he would find them out. And so\n",
      "Ivan Petrovitch _really_ knew Natalia Nikitishna!âwhat a saintly nature\n",
      "was hers!âand Martha Nikitishna! Ivan Petrovitch must excuse him, but\n",
      "really he was not quite fair on dear old Martha. She was severe,\n",
      "perhaps; but then what else could she be with such a little idiot as he\n",
      "was then? (Ha, ha.) He really was an idiot then, Ivan Petrovitch must\n",

      "\n",

      "next morning.\n",

      "\n",
      "The prince trembled all over. Why was he so agitated? Why had he flown\n",
      "into such transports of delight without any apparent reason? He had far\n",
      "outshot the measure of joy and emotion consistent with the occasion.\n",
      "Why this was it would be difficult to say.\n",

      "He seemed to feel warmly and deeply grateful to someone for something\n",

      "Evgenie, Prince S., and the girls, all broke off their own\n",

      "\n",
      "This was odd of Lizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters. They had\n",

      "all the evening. Yet seeing him sitting silent and alone, but perfectly\n",
      "happy, they had been on the point of exerting themselves to draw him\n",
      "into one of the groups of talkers around the room. Now that he was in\n",

      "\n",
      "âThat he was a splendid man is perfectly true; you are quite right,â\n",

      "worthy fellowâworthy, one may say, of the highest respect,â he added,\n",
      "more and more seriously at each pause; âand it is agreeable to see, on\n",

      "richâa man who, if he had continued to serve, might have done anything;\n",

      "over to Roman Catholicism and turn Jesuitâopenly, tooâalmost\n",

      "must allow, my dear prince... However, of course you value the memory\n",
      "of the deceased so very highly; and he certainly was the kindest of\n",
      "men; to which fact, by the way, I ascribe, more than to anything else,\n",
      "the success of the abbot in influencing his religious convictions. But\n",
      "you may ask me, if you please, how much trouble and worry I,\n",

      "had to resort to the very strongest measures in order to bring them to\n",
      "their senses? I assure you they knew their cue, did these\n",
      "gentlemenâwonderful! Thank goodness all this was in Moscow, and I got\n",

      "a fright myself in â32, in Vienna, I assure you; but I didnât cave in\n",

      "\n",
      "âPavlicheff was a man of bright intellect and a good Christian, a\n",
      "sincere Christian,â said the prince, suddenly. âHow could he possibly\n",
      "embrace a faith which is unchristian? Roman Catholicism is, so to\n",
      "speak, simply the same thing as unchristianity,â he added with flashing\n",
      "eyes, which seemed to take in everybody in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome, thatâs a little _too_ strong, isnât it?â murmured the old man,\n",

      "\n",
      "âIt is not a Christian religion, in the first place,â said the latter,\n",
      "in extreme agitation, quite out of proportion to the necessity of the\n",
      "moment. âAnd in the second place, Roman Catholicism is, in my opinion,\n",
      "worse than Atheism itself. Yesâthat is my opinion. Atheism only\n",
      "preaches a negation, but Romanism goes further; it preaches a\n",
      "disfigured, distorted Christâit preaches Anti-ChristâI assure you, I\n",
      "swear it! This is my own personal conviction, and it has long\n",
      "distressed me. The Roman Catholic believes that the Church on earth\n",
      "cannot stand without universal temporal Power. He cries ânon possumus!â\n",
      "In my opinion the Roman Catholic religion is not a faith at all, but\n",
      "simply a continuation of the Roman Empire, and everything is\n",
      "subordinated to this ideaâbeginning with faith. The Pope has seized\n",
      "territories and an earthly throne, and has held them with the sword.\n",
      "And so the thing has gone on, only that to the sword they have added\n",
      "lying, intrigue, deceit, fanaticism, superstition, swindling;âthey have\n",
      "played fast and loose with the most sacred and sincere feelings of\n",
      "men;âthey have exchanged everythingâeverything for money, for base\n",
      "earthly _power!_ And is this not the teaching of Anti-Christ? How could\n",
      "the upshot of all this be other than Atheism? Atheism is the child of\n",
      "Roman Catholicismâit proceeded from these Romans themselves, though\n",
      "perhaps they would not believe it. It grew and fattened on hatred of\n",
      "its parents; it is the progeny of their lies and spiritual feebleness.\n",
      "Atheism! In our country it is only among the upper classes that you\n",
      "find unbelievers; men who have lost the root or spirit of their faith;\n",
      "but abroad whole masses of the people are beginning to profess\n",
      "unbeliefâat first because of the darkness and lies by which they were\n",
      "surrounded; but now out of fanaticism, out of loathing for the Church\n",
      "and Christianity!â\n",
      "\n",

      "All present interchanged glances, but at last the old dignitary burst\n",
      "out laughing frankly. Prince N. took out his eye-glass to have a good\n",

      "\n",

      "seeks to replace in itself the moral power of religion, in order to\n",
      "appease the spiritual thirst of parched humanity and save it; not by\n",

      "\n",
      "During the evening other impressions began to awaken in his mind, as we\n",

      "mentioned and the general introduced him to Ivan Petrovitch, he had\n",
      "changed his place, and went over nearer to the table; when, it so\n",

      "the deep impression of the almost supernatural truth of his\n",
      "premonition. He stood still in alarmâin almost superstitious alarm, for\n",
      "a moment; then all mists seemed to clear away from his eyes; he was\n",
      "conscious of nothing but light and joy and ecstasy; his breath came and\n",

      "breath and looked around.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some minutes he did not seem to comprehend the excitement around\n",

      "an interest in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw them gather up the broken bits of china; he heard the loud\n",
      "talking of the guests and observed how pale Aglaya looked, and how very\n",
      "strangely she was gazing at him. There was no hatred in her expression,\n",
      "and no anger whatever. It was full of alarm for him, and sympathy and\n",
      "affection, while she looked around at the others with flashing, angry\n",
      "eyes. His heart filled with a sweet pain as he gazed at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length he observed, to his amazement, that all had taken their seats\n",
      "again, and were laughing and talking as though nothing had happened.\n",
      "Another minute and the laughter grew louderâthey were laughing at him,\n",
      "at his dumb stuporâlaughing kindly and merrily. Several of them spoke\n",
      "to him, and spoke so kindly and cordially, especially Lizabetha\n",
      "Prokofievnaâshe was saying the kindest possible things to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he became aware that General Epanchin was tapping him on the\n",
      "shoulder; Ivan Petrovitch was laughing too, but still more kind and\n",
      "sympathizing was the old dignitary. He took the prince by the hand and\n",
      "pressed it warmly; then he patted it, and quietly urged him to\n",
      "recollect himselfâspeaking to him exactly as he would have spoken to a\n",
      "little frightened child, which pleased the prince wonderfully; and next\n",
      "seated him beside himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince gazed into his face with pleasure, but still seemed to have\n",

      "\n",
      "âDo you really forgive me?â he said at last. âAndâand Lizabetha\n",

      "fifteen yearsâyes, quite that!â remarked Ivan Petrovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, what a dreadful calamity! A wretched vase smashed, and a man half\n",
      "dead with remorse about it,â said Lizabetha Prokofievna, loudly. âWhat\n",
      "made you so dreadfully startled, Lef Nicolaievitch?â she added, a\n",

      "\n",
      "â_Câest trÃ¨s-curieux et câest trÃ¨s-sÃ©rieux_,â he whispered across the\n",

      "\n",
      "âSo that I have not offended any of you? You will not believe how happy\n",
      "I am to be able to think so. It is as it should be. As if I _could_\n",

      "thing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âCalm yourself, my dear fellow. You are exaggerating again; you really\n",

      "you great credit, but an exaggeration, for all that.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am not exactly thanking you, I am only feeling a growing admiration\n",
      "for youâit makes me happy to look at you. I dare say I am speaking very\n",
      "foolishly, but I must speakâI must explain, if it be out of nothing\n",
      "better than self-respect.â\n",
      "\n",
      "All he said and did was abrupt, confused, feverishâvery likely the\n",
      "words he spoke, as often as not, were not those he wished to say. He\n",
      "seemed to inquire whether he _might_ speak. His eyes lighted on\n",
      "Princess Bielokonski.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAll right, my friend, talk away, talk away!â she remarked. âOnly donât\n",
      "lose your breath; you were in such a hurry when you began, and look\n",
      "what youâve come to now! Donât be afraid of speakingâall these ladies\n",
      "and gentlemen have seen far stranger people than yourself; you donât\n",
      "astonish _them_. You are nothing out-of-the-way remarkable, you know.\n",
      "Youâve done nothing but break a vase, and give us all a fright.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince listened, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWasnât it you,â he said, suddenly turning to the old gentleman, âwho\n",

      "to Siberia, two or three months since?â\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âAnd I have heard of _you_,â continued the prince, addressing Ivan\n",
      "Petrovitch, âthat when some of your villagers were burned out you gave\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âWhat are you making such a fuss about?â said the old lady, with\n",
      "annoyance. âYou are a good fellow, but very silly. One gives you a\n",

      "\n",

      "increasing strangeness. âIâI was afraid of you all, and afraid of\n",
      "myself. I was most afraid of myself. When I returned to Petersburg, I\n",
      "promised myself to make a point of seeing our greatest men, and members\n",
      "of our oldest familiesâthe old families like my own. I am now among\n",
      "princes like myself, am I not? I wished to know you, and it was\n",
      "necessary, very, very necessary. I had always heard so much that was\n",
      "evil said of you allâmore evil than good; as to how small and petty\n",
      "were your interests, how absurd your habits, how shallow your\n",
      "education, and so on. There is so much written and said about you! I\n",
      "came here today with anxious curiosity; I wished to see for myself and\n",
      "form my own convictions as to whether it were true that the whole of\n",
      "this upper stratum of Russian society is _worthless_, has outlived its\n",
      "time, has existed too long, and is only fit to dieâand yet is dying\n",
      "with petty, spiteful warring against that which is destined to\n",
      "supersede it and take its placeâhindering the Coming Men, and knowing\n",
      "not that itself is in a dying condition. I did not fully believe in\n",
      "this view even before, for there never was such a class among\n",
      "usâexcepting perhaps at court, by accidentâor by uniform; but now there\n",

      "The prince certainly was beside himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell? What have I seen?â he continued. âI have seen men of graceful\n",

      "me persons who can understand, who can forgiveâkind, good Russian\n",
      "heartsâhearts almost as kind and cordial as I met abroad. Imagine how\n",
      "delighted I must have been, and how surprised! Oh, let me express this\n",
      "feeling! I have so often heard, and I have even believed, that in\n",
      "society there was nothing but empty forms, and that reality had\n",
      "vanished; but I now see for myself that this can never be the case\n",
      "_here_, among usâit may be the order elsewhere, but not in Russia.\n",
      "Surely you are not all Jesuits and deceivers! I heard Prince N.âs story\n",
      "just now. Was it not simple-minded, spontaneous humour? Could such\n",
      "words come from the lips of a man who is dead?âa man whose heart and\n",
      "talents are dried up? Could dead men and women have treated me so\n",
      "kindly as you have all been treating me to-day? Is there not material\n",

      "what he was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, I had better speak,â continued the prince, with a new outburst of\n",
      "feverish emotion, and turning towards the old man with an air of\n",
      "confidential trustfulness. âYesterday, Aglaya Ivanovna forbade me to\n",
      "talk, and even specified the particular subjects I must not touch\n",
      "uponâshe knows well enough that I am odd when I get upon these matters.\n",
      "I am nearly twenty-seven years old, and yet I know I am little better\n",
      "than a child. I have no right to express my ideas, and said so long\n",
      "ago. Only in Moscow, with Rogojin, did I ever speak absolutely freely!\n",
      "He and I read Pushkin togetherâall his works. Rogojin knew nothing of\n",
      "Pushkin, had not even heard his name. I am always afraid of spoiling a\n",
      "great Thought or Idea by my absurd manner. I have no eloquence, I know.\n",
      "I always make the wrong gesturesâinappropriate gesturesâand therefore I\n",
      "degrade the Thought, and raise a laugh instead of doing my subject\n",
      "justice. I have no sense of proportion either, and that is the chief\n",
      "thing. I know it would be much better if I were always to sit still and\n",
      "say nothing. When I do so, I appear to be quite a sensible sort of a\n",
      "person, and whatâs more, I think about things. But now I must speak; it\n",
      "is better that I should. I began to speak because you looked so kindly\n",
      "at me; you have such a beautiful face. I promised Aglaya Ivanovna\n",
      "yesterday that I would not speak all the evening.â\n",

      "listened silently, and cried softly to himself the while. The prince\n",
      "perceived that this was an impression which would last for the whole of\n",
      "the boyâs life. He made haste to explain his view of the matter, and\n",
      "pointed out that the old manâs approaching death was probably brought\n",

      "Colia had hinted, and Vera had shed tears. What was it?\n",
      "\n",

      "forth in obedience to the mandate; that is, the girls, mamma, and\n",
      "Prince S. Lizabetha Prokofievna went off in a direction exactly\n",
      "contrary to the usual one, and all understood very well what she was\n",
      "driving at, but held their peace, fearing to irritate the good lady.\n",
      "She, as though anxious to avoid any conversation, walked ahead, silent\n",

      "\n",
      "âLook here,â said Lizabetha Prokofievna, turning round suddenly; âwe\n",
      "are passing his house. Whatever Aglaya may think, and in spite of\n",
      "anything that may happen, he is not a stranger to us; besides which, he\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course every one of them followed her.\n",

      "you? Well, it doesnât matter much, for everyone must realize now that\n",
      "it is impossible to be hard on you. Well, _au revoir_. I advise you to\n",
      "have a walk, and then go to sleep again if you can. Come in as usual,\n",

      "\n",
      "And so they took their departure; but in this hasty and kindly designed\n",
      "visit there was hidden a fund of cruelty which Lizabetha Prokofievna\n",
      "never dreamed of. In the words âas usual,â and again in her added,\n",
      "âmine, at all events,â there seemed an ominous knell of some evil to\n",
      "come.\n",

      "wonderful smile, both at coming and again at leave-taking, but had not\n",
      "said a word, not even when the others all professed their friendship\n",
      "for him. She had looked very intently at him, but that was all. Her\n",
      "face had been paler than usual; she looked as though she had slept\n",
      "badly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince made up his mind that he would make a point of going there\n",
      "âas usual,â tonight, and looked feverishly at his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vera came in three minutes after the Epanchins had left. âLef\n",
      "Nicolaievitch,â she said, âAglaya Ivanovna has just given me a message\n",
      "for you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs it a note?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo, a verbal message; she had hardly time even for that. She begs you\n",
      "earnestly not to go out of the house for a single moment all to-day,\n",
      "until seven oâclock in the evening. It may have been nine; I didnât\n",
      "quite hear.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âButâbut, why is this? What does it mean?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât know at all; but she said I was to tell you particularly.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDid she say that?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNot those very words. She only just had time to whisper as she went\n",
      "by; but by the way she looked at me I knew it was important. She looked\n",
      "at me in a way that made my heart stop beating.â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince asked a few more questions, and though he learned nothing\n",
      "else, he became more and more agitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Left alone, he lay down on the sofa, and began to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPerhaps,â he thought, âsomeone is to be with them until nine tonight\n",
      "and she is afraid that I may come and make a fool of myself again, in\n",
      "public.â So he spent his time longing for the evening and looking at\n",
      "his watch. But the clearing-up of the mystery came long before the\n",
      "evening, and came in the form of a new and agonizing riddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Half an hour after the Epanchins had gone, Hippolyte arrived, so tired\n",
      "that, almost unconscious, he sank into a chair, and broke into such a\n",
      "fit of coughing that he could not stop. He coughed till the blood came.\n",
      "His eyes glittered, and two red spots on his cheeks grew brighter and\n",
      "brighter. The prince murmured something to him, but Hippolyte only\n",
      "signed that he must be left alone for a while, and sat silent. At last\n",
      "he came to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI am off,â he said, hoarsely, and with difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "âShall I see you home?â asked the prince, rising from his seat, but\n",
      "suddenly stopping short as he remembered Aglayaâs prohibition against\n",
      "leaving the house. Hippolyte laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât mean that I am going to leave your house,â he continued, still\n",
      "gasping and coughing. âOn the contrary, I thought it absolutely\n",
      "necessary to come and see you; otherwise I should not have troubled\n",
      "you. I am off there, you know, and this time I believe, seriously, that\n",
      "I am off! Itâs all over. I did not come here for sympathy, believe me.\n",
      "I lay down this morning at ten oâclock with the intention of not rising\n",
      "again before that time; but I thought it over and rose just once more\n",
      "in order to come here; from which you may deduce that I had some reason\n",
      "for wishing to come.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt grieves me to see you so, Hippolyte. Why didnât you send me a\n",
      "message? I would have come up and saved you this trouble.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, well! Enough! Youâve pitied me, and thatâs all that good manners\n",
      "exact. I forgot, how are you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm all right; yesterday I was a littleââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âI know, I heard; the china vase caught it! Iâm sorry I wasnât there.\n",
      "Iâve come about something important. In the first place I had, the\n",
      "pleasure of seeing Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Aglaya Ivanovna enjoying\n",
      "a rendezvous on the green bench in the park. I was astonished to see\n",
      "what a fool a man can look. I remarked upon the fact to Aglaya Ivanovna\n",
      "when he had gone. I donât think anything ever surprises you, prince!â\n",
      "added Hippolyte, gazing incredulously at the princeâs calm demeanour.\n",
      "âTo be astonished by nothing is a sign, they say, of a great intellect.\n",
      "In my opinion it would serve equally well as a sign of great\n",
      "foolishness. I am not hinting about you; pardon me! I am very\n",
      "unfortunate today in my expressions.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitchââ began the prince, and\n",
      "paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at\n",
      "his betraying no surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou knew it? Come, thatâs news! But noâperhaps better not tell me. And\n",
      "were you a witness of the meeting?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf you were there yourself you must have known that I was _not_\n",
      "there!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh! but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere.\n",
      "However, I am very glad, on your account, of course. I was beginning to\n",
      "be afraid that Mr. Ganiaâmight have the preference!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMay I ask you, Hippolyte, not to talk of this subject? And not to use\n",
      "such expressions?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âEspecially as you know all, eh?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou are wrong. I know scarcely anything, and Aglaya Ivanovna is aware\n",
      "that I know nothing. I knew nothing whatever about this meeting. You\n",
      "say there was a meeting. Very well; letâs leave it soââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, what do you mean? You said you knew, and now suddenly you know\n",
      "nothing! You say âvery well; letâs leave it so.â But I say, donât be so\n",
      "confiding, especially as you know nothing. You are confiding simply\n",
      "_because_ you know nothing. But do you know what these good people have\n",
      "in their mindsâ eyeâGania and his sister? Perhaps you are suspicious?\n",
      "Well, well, Iâll drop the subject!â he added, hastily, observing the\n",
      "princeâs impatient gesture. âBut Iâve come to you on my own business; I\n",
      "wish to make you a clear explanation. What a nuisance it is that one\n",
      "cannot die without explanations! I have made such a quantity of them\n",
      "already. Do you wish to hear what I have to say?â\n",
      "\n",

      "Your letters to me are a proof of it. You could not love so simple a\n",
      "soul as his, and perhaps in your heart you despised him and laughed at\n",
      "him. All you could love was your shame and the perpetual thought that\n",

      "day after she had been thrown over; others said that he had insisted on\n",
      "her coming, himself, in order to shame and insult her by his taunts and\n",
      "Nihilistic confessions when she reached the house. However all these\n",
      "things might be, the public interest in the matter grew daily,\n",
      "especially as it became clear that the scandalous wedding was\n",
      "undoubtedly to take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that if our readers were to ask an explanation, not of the wild\n",
      "reports about the princeâs Nihilistic opinions, but simply as to how\n",
      "such a marriage could possibly satisfy his real aspirations, or as to\n",
      "the spiritual condition of our hero at this time, we confess that we\n",
      "should have great difficulty in giving the required information.\n",
      "\n",
      "All we know is, that the marriage really was arranged, and that the\n",
      "prince had commissioned Lebedeff and Keller to look after all the\n",
      "necessary business connected with it; that he had requested them to\n",
      "spare no expense; that Nastasia herself was hurrying on the wedding;\n",

      "But, besides the above, we are cognizant of certain other undoubted\n",
      "facts, which puzzle us a good deal because they seem flatly to\n",
      "contradict the foregoing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We suspect, for instance, that having commissioned Lebedeff and the\n",
      "others, as above, the prince immediately forgot all about masters of\n",
      "ceremonies and even the ceremony itself; and we feel quite certain that\n",
      "in making these arrangements he did so in order that he might\n",
      "absolutely escape all thought of the wedding, and even forget its\n",
      "approach if he could, by detailing all business concerning it to\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did he think of all this time, then? What did he wish for? There\n",
      "is no doubt that he was a perfectly free agent all through, and that as\n",
      "far as Nastasia was concerned, there was no force of any kind brought\n",
      "to bear on him. Nastasia wished for a speedy marriage, true!âbut the\n",
      "prince agreed at once to her proposals; he agreed, in fact, so casually\n",
      "that anyone might suppose he was but acceding to the most simple and\n",
      "ordinary suggestion.\n",

      "There are many strange circumstances such as this before us; but in our\n",

      "degree help us to understand the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, let us take one more example. Thus, we know for a fact that\n",
      "during the whole of this fortnight the prince spent all his days and\n",
      "evenings with Nastasia; he walked with her, drove with her; he began to\n",
      "be restless whenever he passed an hour without seeing herâin fact, to\n",
      "all appearances, he sincerely loved her. He would listen to her for\n",
      "hours at a time with a quiet smile on his face, scarcely saying a word\n",
      "himself. And yet we know, equally certainly, that during this period he\n",
      "several times set off, suddenly, to the Epanchinsâ, not concealing the\n",
      "fact from Nastasia Philipovna, and driving the latter to absolute\n",
      "despair. We know also that he was not received at the Epanchinsâ so\n",
      "long as they remained at Pavlofsk, and that he was not allowed an\n",
      "interview with Aglaya;âbut next day he would set off once more on the\n",
      "same errand, apparently quite oblivious of the fact of yesterdayâs\n",
      "visit having been a failure,âand, of course, meeting with another\n",
      "refusal. We know, too, that exactly an hour after Aglaya had fled from\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovnaâs house on that fateful evening, the prince was at\n",
      "the Epanchinsâ,âand that his appearance there had been the cause of the\n",
      "greatest consternation and dismay; for Aglaya had not been home, and\n",
      "the family only discovered then, for the first time, that the two of\n",
      "them had been to Nastasiaâs house together.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was said that Elizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters had there and\n",
      "then denounced the prince in the strongest terms, and had refused any\n",
      "further acquaintance and friendship with him; their rage and\n",
      "denunciations being redoubled when Varia Ardalionovna suddenly arrived\n",
      "and stated that Aglaya had been at her house in a terrible state of\n",
      "mind for the last hour, and that she refused to come home.\n",
      "\n",
      "This last item of news, which disturbed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than\n",
      "anything else, was perfectly true. On leaving Nastasiaâs, Aglaya had\n",
      "felt that she would rather die than face her people, and had therefore\n",
      "gone straight to Nina Alexandrovnaâs. On receiving the news, Lizabetha\n",
      "and her daughters and the general all rushed off to Aglaya, followed by\n",
      "Prince Lef Nicolaievitchâundeterred by his recent dismissal; but\n",
      "through Varia he was refused a sight of Aglaya here also. The end of\n",
      "the episode was that when Aglaya saw her mother and sisters crying over\n",
      "her and not uttering a word of reproach, she had flung herself into\n",
      "their arms and gone straight home with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was said that Gania managed to make a fool of himself even on this\n",
      "occasion; for, finding himself alone with Aglaya for a minute or two\n",
      "when Varia had gone to the Epanchinsâ, he had thought it a fitting\n",
      "opportunity to make a declaration of his love, and on hearing this\n",
      "Aglaya, in spite of her state of mind at the time, had suddenly burst\n",
      "out laughing, and had put a strange question to him. She asked him\n",
      "whether he would consent to hold his finger to a lighted candle in\n",
      "proof of his devotion! Ganiaâit was saidâlooked so comically bewildered\n",
      "that Aglaya had almost laughed herself into hysterics, and had rushed\n",
      "out of the room and upstairs,âwhere her parents had found her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolyte told the prince this last story, sending for him on purpose.\n",
      "When Muishkin heard about the candle and Ganiaâs finger he had laughed\n",
      "so that he had quite astonished Hippolyte,âand then shuddered and burst\n",
      "into tears. The princeâs condition during those days was strange and\n",
      "perturbed. Hippolyte plainly declared that he thought he was out of his\n",
      "mind;âthis, however, was hardly to be relied upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Offering all these facts to our readers and refusing to explain them,\n",
      "we do not for a moment desire to justify our heroâs conduct. On the\n",

      "which his behaviour aroused in the hearts of his friends. Even Vera\n",
      "Lebedeff was angry with him for a while; so was Colia; so was Keller,\n",

      "\n",
      "We may remark here that not only the Epanchins themselves, but all who\n",
      "had anything to do with them, thought it right to break with the prince\n",
      "in consequence of his conduct. Prince S. even went so far as to turn\n",
      "away and cut him dead in the street. But Evgenie Pavlovitch was not\n",
      "afraid to compromise himself by paying the prince a visit, and did so,\n",
      "in spite of the fact that he had recommenced to visit at the\n",
      "Epanchinsâ, where he was received with redoubled hospitality and\n",
      "kindness after the temporary estrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evgenie called upon the prince the day after that on which the\n",
      "Epanchins left Pavlofsk. He knew of all the current rumours,âin fact,\n",
      "he had probably contributed to them himself. The prince was delighted\n",
      "to see him, and immediately began to speak of the Epanchins;âwhich\n",
      "simple and straightforward opening quite took Evgenieâs fancy, so that\n",
      "he melted at once, and plunged _in medias res_ without ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince did not know, up to this, that the Epanchins had left the\n",

      "nodded his head, and said thoughtfully:\n",
      "\n",
      "âI knew it was bound to be so.â Then he added quickly:\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere have they gone to?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Evgenie meanwhile observed him attentively, and the rapidity of the\n",
      "questions, their simplicity, the princeâs candour, and at the same\n",
      "time, his evident perplexity and mental agitation, surprised him\n",
      "considerably. However, he told Muishkin all he could, kindly and in\n",
      "detail. The prince hardly knew anything, for this was the first\n",
      "informant from the household whom he had met since the estrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evgenie reported that Aglaya had been really ill, and that for two\n",
      "nights she had not slept at all, owing to high fever; that now she was\n",
      "better and out of serious danger, but still in a nervous, hysterical\n",
      "state.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs a good thing that there is peace in the house, at all events,â he\n",
      "continued. âThey never utter a hint about the past, not only in\n",
      "Aglayaâs presence, but even among themselves. The old people are\n",
      "talking of a trip abroad in the autumn, immediately after Adelaidaâs\n",
      "wedding; Aglaya received the news in silence.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Evgenie himself was very likely going abroad also; so were Prince S.\n",
      "and his wife, if affairs allowed of it; the general was to stay at\n",
      "home. They were all at their estate of Colmina now, about twenty miles\n",
      "or so from St. Petersburg. Princess Bielokonski had not returned to\n",
      "Moscow yet, and was apparently staying on for reasons of her own.\n",
      "Lizabetha Prokofievna had insisted that it was quite impossible to\n",
      "remain in Pavlofsk after what had happened. Evgenie had told her of all\n",

      "\n",

      "of their refusal to see you.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYesâyes, quite so; you are quite right. I wished to see Aglaya\n",

      "âOh, my dear fellow,â cried Evgenie, warmly, with real sorrow in his\n",
      "voice, âhow could you permit all that to come about as it has? Of\n",
      "course, of course, I know it was all so unexpected. I admit that you,\n",
      "only naturally, lost your head, andâand could not stop the foolish\n",
      "girl; that was not in your power. I quite see so much; but you really\n",
      "should have understood how seriously she cared for you. She could not\n",

      "away and shatter such a treasure! Oh, prince, prince!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, yes, you are quite right again,â said the poor prince, in anguish\n",
      "of mind. âI was wrong, I know. But it was only Aglaya who looked on\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna so; no one else did, you know.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut thatâs just the worst of it all, donât you see, that there was\n",
      "absolutely nothing serious about the matter in reality!â cried Evgenie,\n",
      "beside himself: âExcuse me, prince, but I have thought over all this; I\n",
      "have thought a great deal over it; I know all that had happened before;\n",
      "I know all that took place six months since; and I know there was\n",
      "_nothing_ serious about the matter, it was but fancy, smoke, fantasy,\n",
      "distorted by agitation, and only the alarmed jealousy of an absolutely\n",
      "inexperienced girl could possibly have mistaken it for serious\n",
      "reality.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Evgenie Pavlovitch quite let himself go, and gave the reins to his\n",
      "indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly and reasonably, and with great psychological insight, he drew a\n",
      "picture of the princeâs past relations with Nastasia Philipovna.\n",
      "Evgenie Pavlovitch always had a ready tongue, but on this occasion his\n",
      "eloquence, surprised himself. âFrom the very beginning,â he said, âyou\n",
      "began with a lie; what began with a lie was bound to end with a lie;\n",
      "such is the law of nature. I do not agree, in fact I am angry, when I\n",
      "hear you called an idiot; you are far too intelligent to deserve such\n",
      "an epithet; but you are so far _strange_ as to be unlike others; that\n",
      "you must allow, yourself. Now, I have come to the conclusion that the\n",
      "basis of all that has happened, has been first of all your innate\n",
      "inexperience (remark the expression âinnate,â prince). Then follows\n",
      "your unheard-of simplicity of heart; then comes your absolute want of\n",
      "sense of proportion (to this want you have several times confessed);\n",
      "and lastly, a mass, an accumulation, of intellectual convictions which\n",
      "you, in your unexampled honesty of soul, accept unquestionably as also\n",
      "innate and natural and true. Admit, prince, that in your relations with\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna there has existed, from the very first, something\n",
      "democratic, and the fascination, so to speak, of the âwoman questionâ?\n",
      "I know all about that scandalous scene at Nastasia Philipovnaâs house\n",
      "when Rogojin brought the money, six months ago. Iâll show you yourself\n",
      "as in a looking-glass, if you like. I know exactly all that went on, in\n",
      "every detail, and why things have turned out as they have. You\n",
      "thirsted, while in Switzerland, for your home-country, for Russia; you\n",
      "read, doubtless, many books about Russia, excellent books, I dare say,\n",
      "but hurtful to _you_; and you arrived here; as it were, on fire with\n",
      "the longing to be of service. Then, on the very day of your arrival,\n",
      "they tell you a sad story of an ill-used woman; they tell _you_, a\n",
      "knight, pure and without reproach, this tale of a poor woman! The same\n",

      "fantastic, almost demoniacal, beautyâ(I admit her beauty, of course).\n",
      "\n",
      "âAdd to all this your nervous nature, your epilepsy, and your sudden\n",
      "arrival in a strange townâthe day of meetings and of exciting scenes,\n",
      "the day of unexpected acquaintanceships, the day of sudden actions, the\n",
      "day of meeting with the three lovely Epanchin girls, and among them\n",
      "Aglayaâadd your fatigue, your excitement; add Nastasiaâ s evening\n",

      "yourself at such a moment as that?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, yes, yes!â said the prince, once more, nodding his head, and\n",
      "blushing slightly. âYes, it was so, or nearly soâI know it. And\n",
      "besides, you see, I had not slept the night before, in the train, or\n",
      "the night before that, either, and I was very tired.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course, of course, quite so; thatâs what I am driving at!â\n",
      "continued Evgenie, excitedly. âIt is as clear as possible, and most\n",
      "comprehensible, that you, in your enthusiasm, should plunge headlong\n",
      "into the first chance that came of publicly airing your great idea that\n",
      "you, a prince, and a pure-living man, did not consider a woman\n",
      "disgraced if the sin were not her own, but that of a disgusting social\n",
      "libertine! Oh, heavens! itâs comprehensible enough, my dear prince, but\n",
      "that is not the question, unfortunately! The question is, was there any\n",
      "reality and truth in your feelings? Was it nature, or nothing but\n",
      "intellectual enthusiasm? What do you think yourself? We are told, of\n",
      "course, that a far worse woman was _forgiven_, but we donât find that\n",
      "she was told that she had done well, or that she was worthy of honour\n",
      "and respect! Did not your common-sense show you what was the real state\n",
      "of the case, a few months later? The question is now, not whether she\n",
      "is an innocent woman (I do not insist one way or the otherâI do not\n",
      "wish to); but can her whole career justify such intolerable pride, such\n",
      "insolent, rapacious egotism as she has shown? Forgive me, I am too\n",
      "violent, perhaps, butââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âYesâI dare say it is all as you say; I dare say you are quite right,â\n",
      "muttered the prince once more. âShe is very sensitive and easily put\n",
      "out, of course; but still, she...â\n",
      "\n",
      "âShe is worthy of sympathy? Is that what you wished to say, my good\n",
      "fellow? But then, for the mere sake of vindicating her worthiness of\n",
      "sympathy, you should not have insulted and offended a noble and\n",
      "generous girl in her presence! This is a terrible exaggeration of\n",
      "sympathy! How can you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw\n",
      "her over for the sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that\n",
      "other woman, when you have already made her a formal proposal of\n",
      "marriage? And you _did_ propose to her, you know; you did so before her\n",
      "parents and sisters. Can you be an honest man, prince, if you act so? I\n",
      "ask you! And did you not deceive that beautiful girl when you assured\n",
      "her of your love?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, you are quite right. Oh! I feel that I am very guilty!â said\n",
      "Muishkin, in deepest distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut as if that is enough!â cried Evgenie, indignantly. âAs if it is\n",
      "enough simply to say: âI know I am very guilty!â You are to blame, and\n",
      "yet you persevere in evil-doing. Where was your heart, I should like to\n",
      "know, your _christian heart_, all that time? Did she look as though she\n",
      "were suffering less, at that moment? You saw her faceâwas she suffering\n",
      "less than the other woman? How could you see her suffering and allow it\n",
      "to continue? How could you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut I did not allow it,â murmured the wretched prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHowâwhat do you mean you didnât allow?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âUpon my word, I didnât! To this moment I donât know how it all\n",
      "happened. IâI ran after Aglaya Ivanovna, but Nastasia Philipovna fell\n",
      "down in a faint; and since that day they wonât let me see Aglayaâthatâs\n",
      "all I know.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs all the same; you ought to have run after Aglaya though the other\n",
      "was fainting.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, yes, I oughtâbut I couldnât! She would have diedâshe would have\n",
      "killed herself. You donât know her; and I should have told Aglaya\n",
      "everything afterwardsâbut I see, Evgenie Pavlovitch, you donât know\n",
      "all. Tell me now, why am I not allowed to see Aglaya? I should have\n",
      "cleared it all up, you know. Neither of them kept to the real point,\n",
      "you see. I could never explain what I mean to you, but I think I could\n",
      "to Aglaya. Oh! my God, my God! You spoke just now of Aglayaâs face at\n",
      "the moment when she ran away. Oh, my God! I remember it! Come along,\n",
      "come alongâquick!â He pulled at Evgenieâs coat-sleeve nervously and\n",
      "excitedly, and rose from his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere to?â\n",

      "\n",
      "âOh, sheâll understand, sheâll understand!â cried the prince, clasping\n",
      "his hands. âShe would understand that all this is not the pointânot a\n",
      "bit the real pointâit is quite foreign to the real question.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow can it be foreign? You _are_ going to be married, are you not?\n",

      "\n",
      "Muishkin remembered the doctorâs visit quite well. He remembered that\n",

      "although the prince scouted the idea, Lebedeff had turned up almost\n",
      "immediately with his old friend, explaining that they had just met at\n",
      "the bedside of Hippolyte, who was very ill, and that the doctor had\n",
      "something to tell the prince about the sick man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince had, of course, at once received him, and had plunged into a\n",
      "conversation about Hippolyte. He had given the doctor an account of\n",
      "Hippolyteâs attempted suicide; and had proceeded thereafter to talk of\n",
      "his own malady,âof Switzerland, of Schneider, and so on; and so deeply\n",

      "\n",

      "doctorâa married man and the father of a familyâaddressed such\n",
      "compliments that she was filled with indignation. They parted friends,\n",
      "and, after leaving the prince, the doctor said to Lebedeff: âIf all\n",
      "such people were put under restraint, there would be no one left for\n",
      "keepers.â Lebedeff then, in tragic tones, told of the approaching\n",
      "marriage, whereupon the other nodded his head and replied that, after\n",
      "all, marriages like that were not so rare; that he had heard that the\n",
      "lady was very fascinating and of extraordinary beauty, which was enough\n",
      "to explain the infatuation of a wealthy man; that, further, thanks to\n",
      "the liberality of Totski and of Rogojin, she possessedâso he had\n",
      "heardânot only money, but pearls, diamonds, shawls, and furniture, and\n",
      "consequently she could not be considered a bad match. In brief, it\n",
      "seemed to the doctor that the princeâs choice, far from being a sign of\n",
      "foolishness, denoted, on the contrary, a shrewd, calculating, and\n",
      "practical mind. Lebedeff had been much struck by this point of view,\n",
      "and he terminated his confession by assuring the prince that he was\n",
      "ready, if need be, to shed his very lifeâs blood for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolyte, too, was a source of some distraction to the prince at this\n",
      "time; he would send for him at any and every hour of the day. They\n",
      "lived,âHippolyte and his mother and the children,âin a small house not\n",
      "far off, and the little ones were happy, if only because they were able\n",
      "to escape from the invalid into the garden. The prince had enough to do\n",
      "in keeping the peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother,\n",
      "and eventually the former became so malicious and sarcastic on the\n",
      "subject of the approaching wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last,\n",
      "and refused to continue his visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of days later, however, Hippolyteâs mother came with tears in\n",
      "her eyes, and begged the prince to come back, âor _he_ would eat her up\n",
      "bodily.â She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose. Of\n",
      "course the prince went. There was no secret, however, unless we reckon\n",

      "different order of beings. If he sets his heart on a thing he wonât be\n",

      "\n",
      "Hippolyte was very ill, and looked as though he could not long survive.\n",

      "as the interview proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince questioned him in detail as to his hints about Rogojin. He\n",
      "was anxious to seize upon some facts which might confirm Hippolyteâs\n",
      "vague warnings; but there were none; only Hippolyteâs own private\n",

      "questions, and only smiled in response to Hippolyteâs advice to ârun\n",

      "of his looking melancholy; she would try singing to him, and telling\n",
      "him every sort of funny story or reminiscence that she could recall.\n",
      "The prince nearly always pretended to be amused, whether he were so\n",
      "actually or no; but often enough he laughed sincerely, delighted by the\n",
      "brilliancy of her wit when she was carried away by her narrative, as\n",
      "she very often was. Nastasia would be wild with joy to see the\n",
      "impression she had made, and to hear his laugh of real amusement; and\n",
      "she would remain the whole evening in a state of pride and happiness.\n",
      "But this evening her melancholy and thoughtfulness grew with every\n",
      "hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince had told Evgenie Pavlovitch with perfect sincerity that he\n",
      "loved Nastasia Philipovna with all his soul. In his love for her there\n",
      "was the sort of tenderness one feels for a sick, unhappy child which\n",
      "cannot be left alone. He never spoke of his feelings for Nastasia to\n",
      "anyone, not even to herself. When they were together they never\n",
      "discussed their âfeelings,â and there was nothing in their cheerful,\n",
      "animated conversation which an outsider could not have heard. Daria\n",
      "Alexeyevna, with whom Nastasia was staying, told afterwards how she had\n",
      "been filled with joy and delight only to look at them, all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the manner in which he regarded Nastasiaâs mental and moral\n",
      "condition, the prince was to some extent freed from other perplexities.\n",
      "She was now quite different from the woman he had known three months\n",
      "before. He was not astonished, for instance, to see her now so\n",
      "impatient to marry himâshe who formerly had wept with rage and hurled\n",
      "curses and reproaches at him if he mentioned marriage! âIt shows that\n",
      "she no longer fears, as she did then, that she would make me unhappy by\n",
      "marrying me,â he thought. And he felt sure that so sudden a change\n",
      "could not be a natural one. This rapid growth of self-confidence could\n",
      "not be due only to her hatred for Aglaya. To suppose that would be to\n",
      "suspect the depth of her feelings. Nor could it arise from dread of the\n",
      "fate that awaited her if she married Rogojin. These causes, indeed, as\n",
      "well as others, might have played a part in it, but the true reason,\n",
      "Muishkin decided, was the one he had long suspectedâthat the poor sick\n",
      "soul had come to the end of its forces. Yet this was an explanation\n",
      "that did not procure him any peace of mind. At times he seemed to be\n",
      "making violent efforts to think of nothing, and one would have said\n",
      "that he looked on his marriage as an unimportant formality, and on his\n",
      "future happiness as a thing not worth considering. As to conversations\n",
      "such as the one held with Evgenie Pavlovitch, he avoided them as far as\n",
      "possible, feeling that there were certain objections to which he could\n",
      "make no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince had observed that Nastasia knew well enough what Aglaya was\n",
      "to him. He never spoke of it, but he had seen her face when she had\n",
      "caught him starting off for the Epanchinsâ house on several occasions.\n",
      "When the Epanchins left Pavlofsk, she had beamed with radiance and\n",
      "happiness. Unsuspicious and unobservant as he was, he had feared at\n",
      "that time that Nastasia might have some scheme in her mind for a scene\n",
      "or scandal which would drive Aglaya out of Pavlofsk. She had encouraged\n",
      "the rumours and excitement among the inhabitants of the place as to her\n",
      "marriage with the prince, in order to annoy her rival; and, finding it\n",
      "difficult to meet the Epanchins anywhere, she had, on one occasion,\n",
      "taken him for a drive past their house. He did not observe what was\n",
      "happening until they were almost passing the windows, when it was too\n",
      "late to do anything. He said nothing, but for two days afterwards he\n",
      "was ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia did not try that particular experiment again. A few days\n",
      "before that fixed for the wedding, she grew grave and thoughtful. She\n",
      "always ended by getting the better of her melancholy, and becoming\n",
      "merry and cheerful again, but not quite so unaffectedly happy as she\n",
      "had been some days earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince redoubled his attentive study of her symptoms. It was a most\n",
      "curious circumstance, in his opinion, that she never spoke of Rogojin.\n",
      "But once, about five days before the wedding, when the prince was at\n",
      "home, a messenger arrived begging him to come at once, as Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna was very ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had found her in a condition approaching to absolute madness. She\n",
      "screamed, and trembled, and cried out that Rogojin was hiding out there\n",
      "in the gardenâthat she had seen him herselfâand that he would murder\n",
      "her in the nightâthat he would cut her throat. She was terribly\n",
      "agitated all day. But it so happened that the prince called at\n",
      "Hippolyteâs house later on, and heard from his mother that she had been\n",
      "in town all day, and had there received a visit from Rogojin, who had\n",
      "made inquiries about Pavlofsk. On inquiry, it turned out that Rogojin\n",
      "visited the old lady in town at almost the same moment when Nastasia\n",
      "declared that she had seen him in the garden; so that the whole thing\n",
      "turned out to be an illusion on her part. Nastasia immediately went\n",
      "across to Hippolyteâs to inquire more accurately, and returned\n",
      "immensely relieved and comforted.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the day before the wedding, the prince left Nastasia in a state of\n",
      "great animation. Her wedding-dress and all sorts of finery had just\n",
      "arrived from town. Muishkin had not imagined that she would be so\n",
      "excited over it, but he praised everything, and his praise rendered her\n",
      "doubly happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Nastasia could not hide the cause of her intense interest in her\n",
      "wedding splendour. She had heard of the indignation in the town, and\n",
      "knew that some of the populace was getting up a sort of charivari with\n",
      "music, that verses had been composed for the occasion, and that the\n",
      "rest of Pavlofsk society more or less encouraged these preparations.\n",
      "So, since attempts were being made to humiliate her, she wanted to hold\n",
      "her head even higher than usual, and to overwhelm them all with the\n",
      "beauty and taste of her toilette. âLet them shout and whistle, if they\n",
      "dare!â Her eyes flashed at the thought. But, underneath this, she had\n",
      "another motive, of which she did not speak. She thought that possibly\n",
      "Aglaya, or at any rate someone sent by her, would be present incognito\n",
      "at the ceremony, or in the crowd, and she wished to be prepared for\n",
      "this eventuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince left her at eleven, full of these thoughts, and went home.\n",
      "But it was not twelve oâclock when a messenger came to say that\n",
      "Nastasia was very bad, and he must come at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "On hurrying back he found his bride locked up in her own room and could\n",
      "hear her hysterical cries and sobs. It was some time before she could\n",
      "be made to hear that the prince had come, and then she opened the door\n",
      "only just sufficiently to let him in, and immediately locked it behind\n",
      "him. She then fell on her knees at his feet. (So at least Dana\n",
      "Alexeyevna reported.)\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat am I doing? What am I doing to you?â she sobbed convulsively,\n",
      "embracing his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was a whole hour soothing and comforting her, and left her,\n",
      "at length, pacified and composed. He sent another messenger during the\n",
      "night to inquire after her, and two more next morning. The last brought\n",
      "back a message that Nastasia was surrounded by a whole army of\n",
      "dressmakers and maids, and was as happy and as busy as such a beauty\n",
      "should be on her wedding morning, and that there was not a vestige of\n",
      "yesterdayâs agitation remaining. The message concluded with the news\n",
      "that at the moment of the bearerâs departure there was a great\n",
      "confabulation in progress as to which diamonds were to be worn, and\n",
      "how.\n",
      "\n",
      "This message entirely calmed the princeâs mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following report of the proceedings on the wedding day may be\n",
      "depended upon, as coming from eye-witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedding was fixed for eight oâclock in the evening. Nastasia\n",
      "Philipovna was ready at seven. From six oâclock groups of people began\n",
      "to gather at Nastasiaâs house, at the princeâs, and at the church door,\n",
      "but more especially at the former place. The church began to fill at\n",
      "seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colia and Vera Lebedeff were very anxious on the princeâs account, but\n",
      "they were so busy over the arrangements for receiving the guests after\n",
      "the wedding, that they had not much time for the indulgence of personal\n",
      "feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were to be very few guests besides the best men and so on; only\n",
      "Dana Alexeyevna, the Ptitsins, Gania, and the doctor. When the prince\n",
      "asked Lebedeff why he had invited the doctor, who was almost a\n",
      "stranger, Lebedeff replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy, he wears an âorder,â and it looks so well!â\n",
      "\n",
      "This idea amused the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keller and Burdovsky looked wonderfully correct in their dress-coats\n",
      "and white kid gloves, although Keller caused the bridegroom some alarm\n",
      "by his undisguisedly hostile glances at the gathering crowd of\n",
      "sight-seers outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "At about half-past seven the prince started for the church in his\n",
      "carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may remark here that he seemed anxious not to omit a single one of\n",
      "the recognized customs and traditions observed at weddings. He wished\n",
      "all to be done as openly as possible, and âin due order.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived at the church, Muishkin, under Kellerâs guidance, passed\n",
      "through the crowd of spectators, amid continuous whispering and excited\n",
      "exclamations. The prince stayed near the altar, while Keller made off\n",
      "once more to fetch the bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the gate of Daria Alexeyevnaâs house, Keller found a far\n",
      "denser crowd than he had encountered at the princeâs. The remarks and\n",
      "exclamations of the spectators here were of so irritating a nature that\n",
      "Keller was very near making them a speech on the impropriety of their\n",
      "conduct, but was luckily caught by Burdovsky, in the act of turning to\n",
      "address them, and hurried indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia Philipovna was ready. She rose from her seat, looked into the\n",
      "glass and remarked, as Keller told the tale afterwards, that she was\n",
      "âas pale as a corpse.â She then bent her head reverently, before the\n",
      "ikon in the corner, and left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "A torrent of voices greeted her appearance at the front door. The crowd\n",
      "whistled, clapped its hands, and laughed and shouted; but in a moment\n",
      "or two isolated voices were distinguishable.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat a beauty!â cried one.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, she isnât the first in the world, nor the last,â said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMarriage covers everything,â observed a third.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI defy you to find another beauty like that,â said a fourth.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSheâs a real princess! Iâd sell my soul for such a princess as that!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia came out of the house looking as white as any handkerchief;\n",
      "but her large dark eyes shone upon the vulgar crowd like blazing coals.\n",
      "The spectatorsâ cries were redoubled, and became more exultant and\n",
      "triumphant every moment. The door of the carriage was open, and Keller\n",
      "had given his hand to the bride to help her in, when suddenly with a\n",
      "loud cry she rushed from him, straight into the surging crowd. Her\n",
      "friends about her were stupefied with amazement; the crowd parted as\n",
      "she rushed through it, and suddenly, at a distance of five or six yards\n",
      "from the carriage, appeared Rogojin. It was his look that had caught\n",
      "her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nastasia rushed to him like a madwoman, and seized both his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSave me!â she cried. âTake me away, anywhere you like, quick!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin seized her in his arms and almost carried her to the carriage.\n",
      "Then, in a flash, he tore a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket and\n",
      "held it to the coachman.\n",
      "\n",
      "âTo the station, quick! If you catch the train you shall have another.\n",
      "Quick!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He leaped into the carriage after Nastasia and banged the door. The\n",
      "coachman did not hesitate a moment; he whipped up the horses, and they\n",
      "were off.\n",
      "\n",
      "âOne more second and I should have stopped him,â said Keller,\n",
      "afterwards. In fact, he and Burdovsky jumped into another carriage and\n",
      "set off in pursuit; but it struck them as they drove along that it was\n",
      "not much use trying to bring Nastasia back by force.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBesides,â said Burdovsky, âthe prince would not like it, would he?â So\n",
      "they gave up the pursuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna reached the station just in time for\n",
      "the train. As he jumped out of the carriage and was almost on the point\n",
      "of entering the train, Rogojin accosted a young girl standing on the\n",
      "platform and wearing an old-fashioned, but respectable-looking, black\n",
      "cloak and a silk handkerchief over her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "âTake fifty roubles for your cloak?â he shouted, holding the money out\n",
      "to the girl. Before the astonished young woman could collect her\n",
      "scattered senses, he pushed the money into her hand, seized the mantle,\n",
      "and threw it and the handkerchief over Nastasiaâs head and shoulders.\n",
      "The latterâs wedding-array would have attracted too much attention, and\n",
      "it was not until some time later that the girl understood why her old\n",
      "cloak and kerchief had been bought at such a price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news of what had happened reached the church with extraordinary\n",
      "rapidity. When Keller arrived, a host of people whom he did not know\n",
      "thronged around to ask him questions. There was much excited talking,\n",
      "and shaking of heads, even some laughter; but no one left the church,\n",
      "all being anxious to observe how the now celebrated bridegroom would\n",
      "take the news. He grew very pale upon hearing it, but took it quite\n",
      "quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI was afraid,â he muttered, scarcely audibly, âbut I hardly thought it\n",
      "would come to this.â Then after a short silence, he added: âHowever, in\n",
      "her state, it is quite consistent with the natural order of things.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Keller admitted afterwards that this was âextraordinarily\n",
      "philosophicalâ on the princeâs part. He left the church quite calm, to\n",
      "all appearances, as many witnesses were found to declare afterwards. He\n",
      "seemed anxious to reach home and be left alone as quickly as possible;\n",
      "but this was not to be. He was accompanied by nearly all the invited\n",
      "guests, and besides this, the house was almost besieged by excited\n",
      "bands of people, who insisted upon being allowed to enter the verandah.\n",
      "The prince heard Keller and Lebedeff remonstrating and quarrelling with\n",
      "these unknown individuals, and soon went out himself. He approached the\n",
      "disturbers of his peace, requested courteously to be told what was\n",
      "desired; then politely putting Lebedeff and Keller aside, he addressed\n",
      "an old gentleman who was standing on the verandah steps at the head of\n",
      "the band of would-be guests, and courteously requested him to honour\n",
      "him with a visit. The old fellow was quite taken aback by this, but\n",
      "entered, followed by a few more, who tried to appear at their ease. The\n",
      "rest remained outside, and presently the whole crowd was censuring\n",
      "those who had accepted the invitation. The prince offered seats to his\n",
      "strange visitors, tea was served, and a general conversation sprang up.\n",
      "Everything was done most decorously, to the considerable surprise of\n",
      "the intruders. A few tentative attempts were made to turn the\n",
      "conversation to the events of the day, and a few indiscreet questions\n",
      "were asked; but Muishkin replied to everybody with such simplicity and\n",
      "good-humour, and at the same time with so much dignity, and showed such\n",
      "confidence in the good breeding of his guests, that the indiscreet\n",
      "talkers were quickly silenced. By degrees the conversation became\n",
      "almost serious. One gentleman suddenly exclaimed, with great vehemence:\n",
      "âWhatever happens, I shall not sell my property; I shall wait.\n",
      "Enterprise is better than money, and there, sir, you have my whole\n",
      "system of economy, if you wish!â He addressed the prince, who warmly\n",
      "commended his sentiments, though Lebedeff whispered in his ear that\n",
      "this gentleman, who talked so much of his âproperty,â had never had\n",
      "either house or home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly an hour passed thus, and when tea was over the visitors seemed\n",
      "to think that it was time to go. As they went out, the doctor and the\n",
      "old gentleman bade Muishkin a warm farewell, and all the rest took\n",
      "their leave with hearty protestations of good-will, dropping remarks to\n",
      "the effect that âit was no use worrying,â and that âperhaps all would\n",
      "turn out for the best,â and so on. Some of the younger intruders would\n",
      "have asked for champagne, but they were checked by the older ones. When\n",
      "all had departed, Keller leaned over to Lebedeff, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "âWith you and me there would have been a scene. We should have shouted\n",
      "and fought, and called in the police. But he has simply made some new\n",
      "friendsâand such friends, too! I know them!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebedeff, who was slightly intoxicated, answered with a sigh:\n",
      "\n",
      "âThings are hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes.\n",
      "I have applied those words to him before, but now I add that God has\n",
      "preserved the babe himself from the abyss, He and all His saints.â\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, about half-past ten, the prince was left alone. His head\n",
      "ached. Colia was the last to go, after having helped him to change his\n",
      "wedding clothes. They parted on affectionate terms, and, without\n",
      "speaking of what had happened, Colia promised to come very early the\n",
      "next day. He said later that the prince had given no hint of his\n",
      "intentions when they said good-bye, but had hidden them even from him.\n",
      "Soon there was hardly anyone left in the house. Burdovsky had gone to\n",
      "see Hippolyte; Keller and Lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only Vera Lebedeff remained hurriedly rearranging the furniture in the\n",
      "rooms. As she left the verandah, she glanced at the prince. He was\n",
      "seated at the table, with both elbows upon it, and his head resting on\n",
      "his hands. She approached him, and touched his shoulder gently. The\n",
      "prince started and looked at her in perplexity; he seemed to be\n",
      "collecting his senses for a minute or so, before he could remember\n",
      "where he was. As recollection dawned upon him, he became violently\n",
      "agitated. All he did, however, was to ask Vera very earnestly to knock\n",
      "at his door and awake him in time for the first train to Petersburg\n",
      "next morning. Vera promised, and the prince entreated her not to tell\n",
      "anyone of his intention. She promised this, too; and at last, when she\n",
      "had half-closed the door, he called her back a third time, took her\n",
      "hands in his, kissed them, then kissed her forehead, and in a rather\n",
      "peculiar manner said to her, âUntil tomorrow!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was Veraâs story afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went away in great anxiety about him, but when she saw him in the\n",
      "morning, he seemed to be quite himself again, greeted her with a smile,\n",
      "and told her that he would very likely be back by the evening. It\n",
      "appears that he did not consider it necessary to inform anyone\n",
      "excepting Vera of his departure for town.\n",
      "\n",
      "XI.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour later he was in St. Petersburg, and by ten oâclock he had rung\n",
      "the bell at Rogojinâs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had gone to the front door, and was kept waiting a long while before\n",
      "anyone came. At last the door of old Mrs. Rogojinâs flat was opened,\n",
      "and an aged servant appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "âParfen Semionovitch is not at home,â she announced from the doorway.\n",
      "âWhom do you want?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âParfen Semionovitch.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe is not in.â\n",
      "\n",

      "nobody came.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, he may have gone out. I canât tell. Sometimes he takes the keys\n",

      "\n",
      "âDo you know for certain that he was at home last night?â\n",

      "\n",
      "The prince went out deep in thought, and walked up and down the\n",
      "pavement for some time. The windows of all the rooms occupied by\n",
      "Rogojin were closed, those of his motherâs apartments were open. It was\n",
      "a hot, bright day. The prince crossed the road in order to have a good\n",
      "look at the windows again; not only were Rogojinâs closed, but the\n",
      "white blinds were all down as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood there for a minute and then, suddenly and strangely enough, it\n",
      "seemed to him that a little corner of one of the blinds was lifted, and\n",
      "Rogojinâs face appeared for an instant and then vanished. He waited\n",
      "another minute, and decided to go and ring the bell once more; however,\n",
      "he thought better of it again and put it off for an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief object in his mind at this moment was to get as quickly as he\n",
      "could to Nastasia Philipovnaâs lodging. He remembered that, not long\n",
      "since, when she had left Pavlofsk at his request, he had begged her to\n",
      "put up in town at the house of a respectable widow, who had\n",
      "well-furnished rooms to let, near the Ismailofsky barracks. Probably\n",
      "Nastasia had kept the rooms when she came down to Pavlofsk this last\n",
      "time; and most likely she would have spent the night in them, Rogojin\n",
      "having taken her straight there from the station.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince took a droshky. It struck him as he drove on that he ought\n",
      "to have begun by coming here, since it was most improbable that Rogojin\n",
      "should have taken Nastasia to his own house last night. He remembered\n",
      "that the porter said she very rarely came at all, so that it was still\n",
      "less likely that she would have gone there so late at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vainly trying to comfort himself with these reflections, the prince\n",
      "reached the Ismailofsky barracks more dead than alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his consternation the good people at the lodgings had not only heard\n",
      "nothing of Nastasia, but all came out to look at him as if he were a\n",
      "marvel of some sort. The whole family, of all ages, surrounded him, and\n",
      "he was begged to enter. He guessed at once that they knew perfectly\n",
      "well who he was, and that yesterday ought to have been his wedding-day;\n",
      "and further that they were dying to ask about the wedding, and\n",
      "especially about why he should be here now, inquiring for the woman who\n",
      "in all reasonable human probability might have been expected to be with\n",
      "him in Pavlofsk.\n",
      "\n",
      "He satisfied their curiosity, in as few words as possible, with regard\n",
      "to the wedding, but their exclamations and sighs were so numerous and\n",
      "sincere that he was obliged to tell the whole storyâin a short form, of\n",
      "course. The advice of all these agitated ladies was that the prince\n",
      "should go at once and knock at Rogojinâs until he was let in: and when\n",
      "let in insist upon a substantial explanation of everything. If Rogojin\n",
      "was really not at home, the prince was advised to go to a certain\n",
      "house, the address of which was given, where lived a German lady, a\n",
      "friend of Nastasia Philipovnaâs. It was possible that she might have\n",
      "spent the night there in her anxiety to conceal herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince rose from his seat in a condition of mental collapse. The\n",
      "good ladies reported afterwards that âhis pallor was terrible to see,\n",
      "and his legs seemed to give way underneath him.â With difficulty he was\n",
      "made to understand that his new friends would be glad of his address,\n",
      "in order to act with him if possible. After a momentâs thought he gave\n",
      "the address of the small hotel, on the stairs of which he had had a fit\n",
      "some five weeks since. He then set off once more for Rogojinâs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time they neither opened the door at Rogojinâs flat nor at the one\n",
      "opposite. The prince found the porter with difficulty, but when found,\n",
      "the man would hardly look at him or answer his questions, pretending to\n",
      "be busy. Eventually, however, he was persuaded to reply so far as to\n",
      "state that Rogojin had left the house early in the morning and gone to\n",
      "Pavlofsk, and that he would not return today at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI shall wait; he may come back this evening.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe may not be home for a week.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen, at all events, he _did_ sleep here, did he?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWellâhe did sleep here, yes.â\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was suspicious and unsatisfactory. Very likely the porter had\n",
      "received new instructions during the interval of the princeâs absence;\n",
      "his manner was so different now. He had been obligingânow he was as\n",
      "obstinate and silent as a mule. However, the prince decided to call\n",
      "again in a couple of hours, and after that to watch the house, in case\n",
      "of need. His hope was that he might yet find Nastasia at the address\n",
      "which he had just received. To that address he now set off at full\n",
      "speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But alas! at the German ladyâs house they did not even appear to\n",
      "understand what he wanted. After a while, by means of certain hints, he\n",
      "was able to gather that Nastasia must have had a quarrel with her\n",
      "friend two or three weeks ago, since which date the latter had neither\n",
      "heard nor seen anything of her. He was given to understand that the\n",
      "subject of Nastasiaâs present whereabouts was not of the slightest\n",
      "interest to her; and that Nastasia might marry all the princes in the\n",
      "world for all she cared! So Muishkin took his leave hurriedly. It\n",
      "struck him now that she might have gone away to Moscow just as she had\n",
      "done the last time, and that Rogojin had perhaps gone after her, or\n",
      "even _with_ her. If only he could find some trace!\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he must take his room at the hotel; and he started off in that\n",
      "direction. Having engaged his room, he was asked by the waiter whether\n",
      "he would take dinner; replying mechanically in the affirmative, he sat\n",
      "down and waited; but it was not long before it struck him that dining\n",
      "would delay him. Enraged at this idea, he started up, crossed the dark\n",
      "passage (which filled him with horrible impressions and gloomy\n",
      "forebodings), and set out once more for Rogojinâs. Rogojin had not\n",
      "returned, and no one came to the door. He rang at the old ladyâs door\n",
      "opposite, and was informed that Parfen Semionovitch would not return\n",
      "for three days. The curiosity with which the old servant stared at him\n",
      "again impressed the prince disagreeably. He could not find the porter\n",
      "this time at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, he crossed the street and watched the windows from the other\n",
      "side, walking up and down in anguish of soul for half an hour or so in\n",
      "the stifling heat. Nothing stirred; the blinds were motionless; indeed,\n",
      "the prince began to think that the apparition of Rogojinâs face could\n",
      "have been nothing but fancy. Soothed by this thought, he drove off once\n",
      "more to his friends at the Ismailofsky barracks. He was expected there.\n",
      "The mother had already been to three or four places to look for\n",
      "Nastasia, but had not found a trace of any kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince said nothing, but entered the room, sat down silently, and\n",
      "stared at them, one after the other, with the air of a man who cannot\n",
      "understand what is being said to him. It was strangeâone moment he\n",
      "seemed to be so observant, the next so absent; his behaviour struck all\n",
      "the family as most remarkable. At length he rose from his seat, and\n",
      "begged to be shown Nastasiaâs rooms. The ladies reported afterwards how\n",
      "he had examined everything in the apartments. He observed an open book\n",
      "on the table, Madam Bovary, and requested the leave of the lady of the\n",
      "house to take it with him. He had turned down the leaf at the open\n",
      "page, and pocketed it before they could explain that it was a library\n",
      "book. He had then seated himself by the open window, and seeing a\n",
      "card-table, he asked who played cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was informed that Nastasia used to play with Rogojin every evening,\n",
      "either at âpreferenceâ or âlittle fool,â or âwhistâ; that this had been\n",
      "their practice since her last return from Pavlofsk; that she had taken\n",
      "to this amusement because she did not like to see Rogojin sitting\n",
      "silent and dull for whole evenings at a time; that the day after\n",
      "Nastasia had made a remark to this effect, Rogojin had whipped a pack\n",
      "of cards out of his pocket. Nastasia had laughed, but soon they began\n",
      "playing. The prince asked where were the cards, but was told that\n",
      "Rogojin used to bring a new pack every day, and always carried it away\n",
      "in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good ladies recommended the prince to try knocking at Rogojinâs\n",
      "once moreânot at once, but in the evening. Meanwhile, the mother would\n",
      "go to Pavlofsk to inquire at Dana Alexeyevnaâs whether anything had\n",
      "been heard of Nastasia there. The prince was to come back at ten\n",
      "oâclock and meet her, to hear her news and arrange plans for the\n",
      "morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the kindly-meant consolations of his new friends, the\n",
      "prince walked to his hotel in inexpressible anguish of spirit, through\n",
      "the hot, dusty streets, aimlessly staring at the faces of those who\n",
      "passed him. Arrived at his destination, he determined to rest awhile in\n",
      "his room before he started for Rogojinâs once more. He sat down, rested\n",
      "his elbows on the table and his head on his hands, and fell to\n",
      "thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heaven knows how long and upon what subjects he thought. He thought of\n",
      "many thingsâof Vera Lebedeff, and of her father; of Hippolyte; of\n",
      "Rogojin himself, first at the funeral, then as he had met him in the\n",
      "park, then, suddenly, as they had met in this very passage, outside,\n",
      "when Rogojin had watched in the darkness and awaited him with uplifted\n",
      "knife. The prince remembered his enemyâs eyes as they had glared at him\n",
      "in the darkness. He shuddered, as a sudden idea struck him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This idea was, that if Rogojin were in Petersburg, though he might hide\n",
      "for a time, yet he was quite sure to come to himâthe princeâbefore\n",
      "long, with either good or evil intentions, but probably with the same\n",
      "intention as on that other occasion. At all events, if Rogojin were to\n",
      "come at all he would be sure to seek the prince hereâhe had no other\n",
      "town addressâperhaps in this same corridor; he might well seek him here\n",
      "if he needed him. And perhaps he did need him. This idea seemed quite\n",
      "natural to the prince, though he could not have explained why he should\n",
      "so suddenly have become necessary to Rogojin. Rogojin would not come if\n",
      "all were well with him, that was part of the thought; he would come if\n",
      "all were not well; and certainly, undoubtedly, all would not be well\n",
      "with him. The prince could not bear this new idea; he took his hat and\n",
      "rushed out towards the street. It was almost dark in the passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhat if he were to come out of that corner as I go by andâand stop\n",
      "me?â thought the prince, as he approached the familiar spot. But no one\n",
      "came out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed under the gateway and into the street. The crowds of people\n",
      "walking aboutâas is always the case at sunset in Petersburg, during the\n",
      "summerâsurprised him, but he walked on in the direction of Rogojinâs\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\n",
      "About fifty yards from the hotel, at the first cross-road, as he passed\n",
      "through the crowd of foot-passengers sauntering along, someone touched\n",
      "his shoulder, and said in a whisper into his ear:\n",
      "\n",
      "âLef Nicolaievitch, my friend, come along with me.â It was Rogojin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince immediately began to tell him, eagerly and joyfully, how he\n",
      "had but the moment before expected to see him in the dark passage of\n",
      "the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI was there,â said Rogojin, unexpectedly. âCome along.â The prince was\n",
      "surprised at this answer; but his astonishment increased a couple of\n",
      "minutes afterwards, when he began to consider it. Having thought it\n",
      "over, he glanced at Rogojin in alarm. The latter was striding along a\n",
      "yard or so ahead, looking straight in front of him, and mechanically\n",
      "making way for anyone he met.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhy did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?â asked\n",
      "the prince, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin stopped and looked at him; then reflected, and replied as\n",
      "though he had not heard the question:\n",
      "\n",
      "âLook here, Lef Nicolaievitch, you go straight on to the house; I shall\n",
      "walk on the other side. See that we keep together.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, Rogojin crossed the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived on the opposite pavement, he looked back to see whether the\n",
      "prince were moving, waved his hand in the direction of the Gorohovaya,\n",
      "and strode on, looking across every moment to see whether Muishkin\n",
      "understood his instructions. The prince supposed that Rogojin desired\n",
      "to look out for someone whom he was afraid to miss; but if so, why had\n",
      "he not told _him_ whom to look out for? So the two proceeded for half a\n",
      "mile or so. Suddenly the prince began to tremble from some unknown\n",
      "cause. He could not bear it, and signalled to Rogojin across the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter came at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIs Nastasia Philipovna at your house?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd was it you looked out of the window under the blind this morning?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âThen why didââ\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prince could not finish his question; he did not know what to\n",
      "say. Besides this, his heart was beating so that he found it difficult\n",
      "to speak at all. Rogojin was silent also and looked at him as before,\n",
      "with an expression of deep thoughtfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, Iâm going,â he said, at last, preparing to recross the road.\n",
      "âYou go along here as before; we will keep to different sides of the\n",
      "road; itâs better so, youâll see.â\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the Gorohovaya, and came near the house, the princeâs\n",
      "legs were trembling so that he could hardly walk. It was about ten\n",
      "oâclock. The old ladyâs windows were open, as before; Rogojinâs were\n",
      "all shut, and in the darkness the white blinds showed whiter than ever.\n",
      "Rogojin and the prince each approached the house on his respective side\n",
      "of the road; Rogojin, who was on the near side, beckoned the prince\n",
      "across. He went over to the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "âEven the porter does not know that I have come home now. I told him,\n",
      "and told them at my motherâs too, that I was off to Pavlofsk,â said\n",
      "Rogojin, with a cunning and almost satisfied smile. âWeâll go in\n",
      "quietly and nobody will hear us.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He had the key in his hand. Mounting the staircase he turned and\n",
      "signalled to the prince to go more softly; he opened the door very\n",
      "quietly, let the prince in, followed him, locked the door behind him,\n",
      "and put the key in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome along,â he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had spoken in a whisper all the way. In spite of his apparent\n",
      "outward composure, he was evidently in a state of great mental\n",
      "agitation. Arrived in a large salon, next to the study, he went to the\n",
      "window and cautiously beckoned the prince up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhen you rang the bell this morning I thought it must be you. I went\n",
      "to the door on tip-toe and heard you talking to the servant opposite. I\n",
      "had told her before that if anyone came and rangâespecially you, and I\n",
      "gave her your nameâshe was not to tell about me. Then I thought, what\n",
      "if he goes and stands opposite and looks up, or waits about to watch\n",
      "the house? So I came to this very window, looked out, and there you\n",
      "were staring straight at me. Thatâs how it came about.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere is Nastasia Philipovna?â asked the prince, breathlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSheâs here,â replied Rogojin, slowly, after a slight pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin raised his eyes and gazed intently at the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âCome,â he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued to speak in a whisper, very deliberately as before, and\n",
      "looked strangely thoughtful and dreamy. Even while he told the story of\n",
      "how he had peeped through the blind, he gave the impression of wishing\n",
      "to say something else. They entered the study. In this room some\n",
      "changes had taken place since the prince last saw it. It was now\n",
      "divided into two equal parts by a heavy green silk curtain stretched\n",
      "across it, separating the alcove beyond, where stood Rogojinâs bed,\n",
      "from the rest of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heavy curtain was drawn now, and it was very dark. The bright\n",
      "Petersburg summer nights were already beginning to close in, and but\n",
      "for the full moon, it would have been difficult to distinguish anything\n",
      "in Rogojinâs dismal room, with the drawn blinds. They could just see\n",
      "one anothers faces, however, though not in detail. Rogojinâs face was\n",
      "white, as usual. His glittering eyes watched the prince with an intent\n",
      "stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHad you not better light a candle?â said Muishkin.\n",

      "âNo, I neednât,â replied Rogojin, and taking the other by the hand he\n",
      "drew him down to a chair. He himself took a chair opposite and drew it\n",
      "up so close that he almost pressed against the princeâs knees. At their\n",
      "side was a little round table.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSit down,â said Rogojin; âletâs rest a bit.â There was silence for a\n",
      "moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI knew you would be at that hotel,â he continued, just as men\n",
      "sometimes commence a serious conversation by discussing any outside\n",
      "subject before leading up to the main point. âAs I entered the passage\n",
      "it struck me that perhaps you were sitting and waiting for me, just as\n",
      "I was waiting for you. Have you been to the old lady at Ismailofsky\n",
      "barracks?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes,â said the prince, squeezing the word out with difficulty owing to\n",
      "the dreadful beating of his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI thought you would. âTheyâll talk about it,â I thought; so I\n",
      "determined to go and fetch you to spend the night hereââWe will be\n",
      "together,â I thought, âfor this one nightâââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âRogojin, _where_ is Nastasia Philipovna?â said the prince, suddenly\n",
      "rising from his seat. He was quaking in all his limbs, and his words\n",
      "came in a scarcely audible whisper. Rogojin rose also.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere,â he whispered, nodding his head towards the curtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAsleep?â whispered the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin looked intently at him again, as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLetâs go inâbut you mustnâtâwellâletâs go in.â\n",
      "\n",
      "He lifted the curtain, pausedâand turned to the prince. âGo in,â he\n",

      "âItâs so dark,â he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYou can see quite enough,â muttered Rogojin.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI can just see thereâs a bedââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âGo nearer,â suggested Rogojin, softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince took a step forwardâthen anotherâand paused. He stood and\n",
      "stared for a minute or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of the men spoke a word while at the bedside. The princeâs\n",
      "heart beat so loud that its knocking seemed to be distinctly audible in\n",
      "the deathly silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now his eyes had become so far accustomed to the darkness that he\n",
      "could distinguish the whole of the bed. Someone was asleep upon itâin\n",
      "an absolutely motionless sleep. Not the slightest movement was\n",
      "perceptible, not the faintest breathing could be heard. The sleeper was\n",
      "covered with a white sheet; the outline of the limbs was hardly\n",
      "distinguishable. He could only just make out that a human being lay\n",
      "outstretched there.\n",
      "\n",
      "All around, on the bed, on a chair beside it, on the floor, were\n",
      "scattered the different portions of a magnificent white silk dress,\n",
      "bits of lace, ribbons and flowers. On a small table at the bedside\n",
      "glittered a mass of diamonds, torn off and thrown down anyhow. From\n",
      "under a heap of lace at the end of the bed peeped a small white foot,\n",
      "which looked as though it had been chiselled out of marble; it was\n",
      "terribly still.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince gazed and gazed, and felt that the more he gazed the more\n",
      "death-like became the silence. Suddenly a fly awoke somewhere, buzzed\n",
      "across the room, and settled on the pillow. The prince shuddered.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLetâs go,â said Rogojin, touching his shoulder. They left the alcove\n",
      "and sat down in the two chairs they had occupied before, opposite to\n",
      "one another. The prince trembled more and more violently, and never\n",
      "took his questioning eyes off Rogojinâs face.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI see you are shuddering, Lef Nicolaievitch,â said the latter, at\n",
      "length, âalmost as you did once in Moscow, before your fit; donât you\n",
      "remember? I donât know what I shall do with youââ\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince bent forward to listen, putting all the strain he could\n",
      "muster upon his understanding in order to take in what Rogojin said,\n",
      "and continuing to gaze at the latterâs face.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWas it you?â he muttered, at last, motioning with his head towards the\n",
      "curtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, it was I,â whispered Rogojin, looking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither spoke for five minutes.\n",

      "âBecause, you know,â Rogojin recommenced, as though continuing a former\n",
      "sentence, âif you were ill now, or had a fit, or screamed, or anything,\n",
      "they might hear it in the yard, or even in the street, and guess that\n",
      "someone was passing the night in the house. They would all come and\n",
      "knock and want to come in, because they know I am not at home. I didnât\n",
      "light a candle for the same reason. When I am not hereâfor two or three\n",
      "days at a time, now and thenâno one comes in to tidy the house or\n",
      "anything; those are my orders. So that I want them to not know we are\n",
      "spending the night hereââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âWait,â interrupted the prince. âI asked both the porter and the woman\n",

      "knewââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âI know you asked. I told them that she had called in for ten minutes,\n",
      "and then gone straight back to Pavlofsk. No one knows she slept here.\n",
      "Last night we came in just as carefully as you and I did today. I\n",
      "thought as I came along with her that she would not like to creep in so\n",
      "secretly, but I was quite wrong. She whispered, and walked on tip-toe;\n",
      "she carried her skirt over her arm, so that it shouldnât rustle, and\n",
      "she held up her finger at me on the stairs, so that I shouldnât make a\n",
      "noiseâit was you she was afraid of. She was mad with terror in the\n",
      "train, and she begged me to bring her to this house. I thought of\n",
      "taking her to her rooms at the Ismailofsky barracks first; but she\n",
      "wouldnât hear of it. She said, âNoânot there; heâll find me out at once\n",
      "there. Take me to your own house, where you can hide me, and tomorrow\n",
      "weâll set off for Moscow.â Thence she would go to Orel, she said. When\n",
      "she went to bed, she was still talking about going to Orel.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWait! What do you intend to do now, Parfen?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, Iâm afraid of you. You shudder and tremble so. Weâll pass the\n",
      "night here together. There are no other beds besides that one; but Iâve\n",
      "thought how weâll manage. Iâll take the cushions off all the sofas, and\n",
      "lay them down on the floor, up against the curtain hereâfor you and\n",
      "meâso that we shall be together. For if they come in and look about\n",
      "now, you know, theyâll find her, and carry her away, and theyâll be\n",
      "asking me questions, and I shall say I did it, and then theyâll take me\n",
      "away, too, donât you see? So let her lie close to usâclose to you and\n",
      "me.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, yes,â agreed the prince, warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNot for anything!â cried the other; âno, no, no!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo I had decided, my friend; not to give her up to anyone,â continued\n",
      "Rogojin. âWeâll be very quiet. I have only been out of the house one\n",
      "hour all day, all the rest of the time I have been with her. I dare say\n",
      "the air is very bad here. It is so hot. Do you find it bad?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât knowâperhapsâby morning it will be.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâve covered her with oilclothâbest American oilcloth, and put the\n",
      "sheet over that, and four jars of disinfectant, on account of the\n",
      "smellâas they did at Moscowâyou remember? And sheâs lying so still; you\n",
      "shall see, in the morning, when itâs light. What! canât you get up?â\n",
      "asked Rogojin, seeing the other was trembling so that he could not rise\n",
      "from his seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMy legs wonât move,â said the prince; âitâs fear, I know. When my fear\n",

      "\n",
      "âWait a bitâIâll make the bed, and you can lie down. Iâll lie down,\n",

      "Muttering these disconnected words, Rogojin began to make up the beds.\n",
      "It was clear that he had devised these beds long before; last night he\n",
      "slept on the sofa. But there was no room for two on the sofa, and he\n",
      "seemed anxious that he and the prince should be close to one another;\n",
      "therefore, he now dragged cushions of all sizes and shapes from the\n",
      "sofas, and made a sort of bed of them close by the curtain. He then\n",
      "approached the prince, and gently helped him to rise, and led him\n",
      "towards the bed. But the prince could now walk by himself, so that his\n",
      "fear must have passed; for all that, however, he continued to shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "âItâs hot weather, you see,â continued Rogojin, as he lay down on the\n",
      "cushions beside Muishkin, âand, naturally, there will be a smell. I\n",
      "darenât open the window. My mother has some beautiful flowers in pots;\n",
      "they have a delicious scent; I thought of fetching them in, but that\n",
      "old servant will find out, sheâs very inquisitive.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, she is inquisitive,â assented the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI thought of buying flowers, and putting them all round her; but I was\n",
      "afraid it would make us sad to see her with flowers round her.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âLook here,â said the prince; he was bewildered, and his brain\n",
      "wandered. He seemed to be continually groping for the questions he\n",
      "wished to ask, and then losing them. âListenâtell meâhow did youâwith a\n",
      "knife?âThat same one?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, that same one.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWait a minute, I want to ask you something else, Parfen; all sorts of\n",
      "things; but tell me first, did you intend to kill her before my\n",
      "wedding, at the church door, with your knife?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âI donât know whether I did or not,â said Rogojin, drily, seeming to be\n",
      "a little astonished at the question, and not quite taking it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "âDid you never take your knife to Pavlofsk with you?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âNo. As to the knife,â he added, âthis is all I can tell you about it.â\n",
      "He was silent for a moment, and then said, âI took it out of the locked\n",
      "drawer this morning about three, for it was in the early morning all\n",
      "thisâhappened. It has been inside the book ever sinceâandâandâthis is\n",
      "what is such a marvel to me, the knife only went in a couple of inches\n",

      "\n",
      "âYesâyesâyesââ The prince jumped up in extraordinary agitation. âI\n",
      "know, I know, Iâve read of that sort of thingâitâs internal\n",
      "haemorrhage, you know. Sometimes there isnât a dropâif the blow goes\n",
      "straight to the heartââ\n",
      "\n",
      "âWaitâlisten!â cried Rogojin, suddenly, starting up. âSomebodyâs\n",
      "walking about, do you hear? In the hall.â Both sat up to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI hear,â said the prince in a whisper, his eyes fixed on Rogojin.\n",

      "âYes.â\n",

      "\n",
      "âYes, lock it.â\n",
      "\n",
      "They locked the door, and both lay down again. There was a long\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, by-the-by,â whispered the prince, hurriedly and excitedly as\n",
      "before, as though he had just seized hold of an idea and was afraid of\n",
      "losing it again. âIâI wanted those cards! They say you played cards\n",
      "with her?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, I played with her,â said Rogojin, after a short silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWhere are the cards?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âHere they are,â said Rogojin, after a still longer pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled out a pack of cards, wrapped in a bit of paper, from his\n",
      "pocket, and handed them to the prince. The latter took them, with a\n",
      "sort of perplexity. A new, sad, helpless feeling weighed on his heart;\n",
      "he had suddenly realized that not only at this moment, but for a long\n",
      "while, he had not been saying what he wanted to say, had not been\n",
      "acting as he wanted to act; and that these cards which he held in his\n",
      "hand, and which he had been so delighted to have at first, were now of\n",
      "no useâno use... He rose, and wrung his hands. Rogojin lay motionless,\n",
      "and seemed neither to hear nor see his movements; but his eyes blazed\n",
      "in the darkness, and were fixed in a wild stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince sat down on a chair, and watched him in alarm. Half an hour\n",
      "went by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Rogojin burst into a loud abrupt laugh, as though he had quite\n",
      "forgotten that they must speak in whispers.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThat officer, eh!âthat young officerâdonât you remember that fellow at\n",
      "the band? Eh? Ha, ha, ha! Didnât she whip him smartly, eh?â\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince jumped up from his seat in renewed terror. When Rogojin\n",
      "quieted down (which he did at once) the prince bent over him, sat down\n",
      "beside him, and with painfully beating heart and still more painful\n",
      "breath, watched his face intently. Rogojin never turned his head, and\n",
      "seemed to have forgotten all about him. The prince watched and waited.\n",
      "Time went onâit began to grow light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rogojin began to wanderâmuttering disconnectedly; then he took to\n",
      "shouting and laughing. The prince stretched out a trembling hand and\n",
      "gently stroked his hair and his cheeksâhe could do nothing more. His\n",
      "legs trembled again and he seemed to have lost the use of them. A new\n",
      "sensation came over him, filling his heart and soul with infinite\n",
      "anguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the daylight grew full and strong; and at last the prince lay\n",
      "down, as though overcome by despair, and laid his face against the\n",
      "white, motionless face of Rogojin. His tears flowed on to Rogojinâs\n",
      "cheek, though he was perhaps not aware of them himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At all events when, after many hours, the door was opened and people\n",
      "thronged in, they found the murderer unconscious and in a raging fever.\n",
      "The prince was sitting by him, motionless, and each time that the sick\n",
      "man gave a laugh, or a shout, he hastened to pass his own trembling\n",
      "hand over his companionâs hair and cheeks, as though trying to soothe\n",
      "and quiet him. But alas! he understood nothing of what was said to him,\n",
      "and recognized none of those who surrounded him.\n",

      "If Schneider himself had arrived then and seen his former pupil and\n",
      "patient, remembering the princeâs condition during the first year in\n",

      "accompanied by a friend, and that both had gone upstairs very secretly\n",

      "But Rogojin added no words of his own in confirmation of this view, and\n",

      "condemned to hard labour in Siberia for fifteen years. He heard his\n",
